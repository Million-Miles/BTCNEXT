### RFC Status

Chrysalis RFCs:
- [RFC-0008](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/text/0008-weighted-uniform-random-tip-selection/0008-weighted-uniform-random-tip-selection.md) (Weighted URTS):
   - Implementation improvements are considered
- [RFC-0012](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/pull/12):
   - Merged.
   - Question [BLAKE2b-512 vs BLAKE2b-256](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/pull/12#discussion_r453506575)
      - @Wolfgang add issue to Protocol RFC repo to switch to BLAKE2b-256 in the future, when BLAKE2b-256 signatures are the default

### ChrysSum Retrospec

#### General Open Questions

- Task assignments
   - See below
- Timelines for RFCs
   - First draft of RFC until end of this week! (doesn't need to be ready PR yet e.g. HackMD is fine, it's OK to propose options, all open questions should be assessable)
- People to include
   - Focus on participants for now
   - Re-evaluate when drafts are done
- Webpage based RFC visualization
   - Present RFCs in a nicer website
   - @Thibault will check Bee-RFC solution

#### Tasks

1. Agree on nice way to implement our layout
   - Use HTML `details` and (nested) `table`: https://gist.github.com/luca-moser/e3afd2ff5af2e6c1374a4135629b28aa
1. Agree on Process to define new _Payload Types_ (by IF and community)
   - Message RFC contains a table with type and link to the payload RFC
   - Each payload type comes in its own RFC also modifying this table
   - Reserve certain range for IF payloads up to 1024
   - Distinction between mandatory core payloads and optional ones
   - Add _Network Version_ to the MS payload and maybe every _Message_:
      - breaking changes in the mandatory core payloads require a version bump
1. Serialization Primitives
   - Describe primitives in Message RFC and reference this in the others 
1. Create _Message_ RFC @Gal
   - Motivate layered approach
   - Describe serialization primitives and its fields
   - Add Payload table
   - Provide unsigned data payload as first trivial example
1. Create _Signed transaction_ RFC @Luca
   - Serialization format
   - Validation rules (e.g. sorting)
   - Move payload length outside the payload: Length of the payload byte-array
1. Create _Milestone Payload_ RFC @Angelo
   - Select signature scheme:
      - Quantum-robust vs conventional
      - Suited for several years of signatures
      - Not malleable
   - Present reasonable alternative for security/PR decision 
   - Describe fields (should include _Network Version_)
1. Create _Address Encoding_ RFC @Wolfgang 
   - Based on Bech32, for W-OTS and ED25519
   - `t5b1` or Keccak-384: https://hackmd.io/bi-t_qOSRuCdYFpkX4_SFQ
      - Since W-OTS will be de-prioritized we should select the easiest solution to implement
      - Keccak-384 is preferable but requires more modularity for the Kerl implementation
      - `t5b1` is more consistent with current interfaces, but also requires additional work to validate and prevent malleability
1. Create _Colored Coins_ RFC @Thibault
   - Motivate Colored Coins
   - Add new Output type extending _Signed transaction_ RFC
1. Create _Indexation Payload_ RFC
   - Provide _Tag_, _Message_ for backward compatibility
1. Create a signed data payload RFC
1. Create one/multiple Stream/MAM RFCs 
1. Multisig - BLS discussion
   - Focus on the existing RFCs first
