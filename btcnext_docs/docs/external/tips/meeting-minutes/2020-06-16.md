# Chrysalis RFC Call - 2020-06-16

## Participants

- Wolfgang
- Thibault
- Luca
- Gal
- Hans

## Action Items

- Everyone develops a layout proposal of UTxO transaction with respect to the design decisions described below
- Schedule a longer meeting to have enough time to discuss the layouts properly

## Topics

### RFC Status

Chrysalis RFCs:
- [RFC-0001](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/pull/1):
   - All comments addressed
   - Review later (minor) changes and approve
- [RFC-0012](https://github.com/Wollac/protocol-rfcs/blob/milestone-merkle-validation/text/0012-milestone-merkle-validation/0012-milestone-merkle-validation.md):
   - Blockers:
      - Merge RFC-0015
      - Finish rust implementation to verify examples and feasibility
- [RFC-0015](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/pull/15):
   - Ready for review, look at it till next call

### UTxO for Chrysalis (with a Coordinator)

- Discussed proposals:
   - Hans: https://github.com/hmoog/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-utxo-model/0011-utxo-model.md
   - Wolfgang: https://hackmd.io/@CcRtfCBnRbW82-AdbFJUig/H1zu0q7p8
   - Gal: https://hackmd.io/@cIrs3AfUSq2uSeQ2tBF9fw/rJoT5xIT8
- Discussed pros/cons of `tx_id` + `tx_output_index` vs `tx_id` + `address`
- Larger transaction size should lead to greater PoW difficulty, but issuing one larger tx should be encouraged over multiple small txs.
- Discussed, whether the the credential/witness should be type-able
- Serialization and model description; different pros/can they can be different for now

## Design decisions

- Design a flexible layout, that is likely to handle Coordicide and future changes; not "just" Chrysalis.
- Use `tx_id` + `tx_output_index`:
  - This is closer to existing UTxO models and improves interoperability 
  - Smaller transaction sizes
  - Higher flexibility of output types (e.g. multiple addresses, no address, ...)
  - `tx_id` + `address` closer (only) to key-value storage model, leading to smaller databases or less lookups. However, this only relevant for output lookups by address. This is less critical than input lookups and might even be disabled/filtered on nodes.
- Each transaction should include `transaction_type`/`version`.
- `input_type` should be added to each input:
  - There are applications for differently typed inputs in one transaction
  - Will be `0` for now
- Each output should be type-able:
   - Use `output_type` or `opcode` as motivated in the RFC
- Use `protobuf`-like design language for the draft process
