# Write To and Read From the Vault

## Run the Example

You can write a `value` associated to a `key` by running the following command from the
[client crate](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/tree/dev/client). The example will also read from the
vault to retrieve the key pair you have created. Feel free to replace the parameter values as you see fit.

```bash
cargo run --example cli store-read-write  --key "yourKey" --value "yourValue"
```

## Expected Output

```plaintext
[2022-06-28T13:36:12Z INFO  cli] Insert value into store "yourValue" with key "yourKey"
[2022-06-28T13:36:12Z INFO  cli] Store contains key "yourKey" ? true
[2022-06-28T13:36:12Z INFO  cli] Value for key "yourKey" ? "yourValue"
```

## Example Code

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/blob/dev/client/examples/cli/main.rs#L212-L232
```
