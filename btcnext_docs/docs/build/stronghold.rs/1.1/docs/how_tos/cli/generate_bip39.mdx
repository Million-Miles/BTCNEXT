# Generate a BIP39 Seed and Mnemonic

## Run the Example

You can create a new [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) seed with an associated
mnemonic phrase in the available languages by running the following command from within the
[client crate](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/tree/dev/client). You can also provide a passphrase to
protect the seed.

```bash
cargo run --example cli bip39-generate  --passphrase "optional-passphrase" --lang "english" --vault-path "vault-path-0" --record-path "record-path-0"
```

## Expected Output

```plaintext
[2022-06-28T14:01:49Z INFO  cli] BIP39 Mnemonic: canyon situate farm wedding cluster budget truck bag goose obtain surround soda cable galaxy spoil utility tip remember scan danger cat lawsuit staff riot
```
