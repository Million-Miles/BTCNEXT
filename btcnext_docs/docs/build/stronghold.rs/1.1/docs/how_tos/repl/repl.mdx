# REPL

Stronghold features a simple read-evaluate print loop (REPL) to showcase basic operations from an interaction command shell-like environment. The REPL maintains a state of a running Stronghold instance to store secrets or configuration data.

You can start REPL from a terminal inside the root folder of Stronghold by running the following command:

```shell
cargo run --example repl
```
