## Engine

Engine is the collection of low-level module with which application architects can build higher-level implementations of Strongholds for a variety of purposes. It is platform agnostic, in that it should run anywhere a Rust Compiler will work.

It is composed of 4 primary module:

- snapshot
- vault
- store
- runtime

### Snapshot

The snapshot protocol follows a fairly simple transparent pattern. Each Snapshot file follows a simple structure:

|  **Header**   |
| :-----------: |
|  Magic Bytes  |
| Version Bytes |
|   **Body**    |
| Ephemeral Key |
| xchacha20 tag |
|  Cipher Text  |
