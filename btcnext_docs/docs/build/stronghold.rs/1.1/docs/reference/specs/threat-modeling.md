# Stronghold Threat Modeling

As a security software, Stronghold prevents attackers from accessing the secrets that it stores.
Threat modeling is a systematic approach that tries to assess all the potential
attack scenarios on software.

There are multiple steps to this process:

1. [Model your software](#model).
2. Define the [assets](#assets) and security property you protect.
3. List [potential threats](#potential-threats-stride) using existing classification (STRIDE in our case).
4. Propose mitigations to those threats

## Strongholdâ€™s Model

Stronghold is simple in concept; it is used to store secrets.
These secrets should never be revealed, even to their owners.
Users can interact with secrets through controlled methods called [procedures](./../../explanations/procedures.md).

### Typical use of Stronghold

### Typical use of Stronghold

1. [Generate a key in Stronghold](./../../how_tos/cli/generate_key_pair.mdx).
2. Use Stronghold procedures to use the key for encryption, decryption, signatures, etc.
3. [Store Stronghold state](./../../how_tos/cli/create_snapshot.mdx) for future usage in permanent storage called [Snapshot](../structure/engine/snapshot.md).

### Model

![Stronghold model](./assets/stronghold_model.drawio.png)

- Users can only interact with secrets through the procedures API.
- Users can only use procedures on the secrets they own
- Procedures cannot reveal/temper secrets (can delete them though)
- Secrets can be kept permanently in an encrypted form in a Snapshot (filesystem)

## Assets

The sole asset of Stronghold is its secrets.

### High Importance

- **Confidentiality**: Secrets are never revealed.
- **_Integrity_**: Secrets cannot be modified, only deleted.
- **Authentication**: Only authorized users can interact with secrets,

### Mid Importance

- **Availability**: A user can interact with its secrets anytime.

### Low Importance

- **Least privilege**: There are no privileged users in Stronghold.
- **Non-repudiation**: A user can't disprove that it has used a procedure on a secret.

## Attack Surface

Stronghold defends against multiple types of attackers.
Levels also represent how likely it is for an attacker to appear.

- **Level 1**: [Procedure API](#level-1-procedure-api).
- **Level 2**: [Permanent storage: Snapshot in the filesystem](#level-2-permanent-storage-file-system).
- **Level 3**: [Memory](#level-3-memory):
  - The attacker can read memory.
  - Through cold-boot attacks or memory dumps.
- **Level 4**: [Side-channels](#level-4-side-channels):
  - Timing attacks.
  - Power consumption.

A type of attacker that we don't represent here but is also important comes from potential vulnerabilities in the tools used to build the software.

- **Bonus**: Tools:
  - Packages.
  - Rust language.
  - Compilation.
  - Crypto algorithms used.

## Potential threats STRIDE

We use the [STRIDE](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process) threats classification.
Stride is applied to all the types of attacks listed [above](#attack-surface).
Mentions of **WIP** means that it is still "Work In Progress".
