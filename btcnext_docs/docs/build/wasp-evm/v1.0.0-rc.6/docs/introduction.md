# EVM/Solidity Based Smart Contracts

:::caution

Smart Contracts are currently only compatible with the [Stardust protocol](/learn/protocols/stardust/introduction) and
therefore only compatible with the [Shimmer](/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmer) and
[Public Testnet networks](/build/networks-endpoints/#public-testnet).

:::

The current release of IOTA Smart Contracts has support for [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)/[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/) smart
contracts, as well as [Wasm](/wasp-wasm/introduction/) smart contracts, providing limited compatibility with existing smart contracts and
tooling from other EVM based chains like Ethereum. This allows us to offer the existing ecosystem around EVM/Solidity a
familiar alternative.

### What is EVM/Solidity?

[EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) stands for "Ethereum Virtual Machine" and is currently the tried and
tested virtual machine running most smart contract implementations.

[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) is the programming language of choice with EVM, which was created for this
specific purpose.

The main benefit of using EVM/Solidity right now is its sheer amount of resources from years of development andf
Smart Contracts implementation is fully compatible with all of them. If you have experience developing on other EVM
based chains, you will feel right at home. Any existing contracts you've written will probably need no (or very minimal)
changes to function on IOTA Smart Contracts.

### How IOTA Smart Contracts Work With EVM

Every deployed IOTA Smart Contracts chain automatically includes a core contract
called [`evm`](./reference/core-contracts/evm.md). This core contract is responsible for running EVM code and
storing the EVM state.

The Wasp node also provides a standard JSON-RPC service, which allows you to interact with the EVM layer using existing
tooling like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
Deploying EVM contracts is as easy as pointing your tools to the JSON-RPC endpoint.
