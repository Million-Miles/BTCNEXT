# ERC20 Example

## Prerequisites

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- [A Metamask Wallet](https://metamask.io/).
- [Connect your MetaMask with the public Testnet](../getting-started/compatible-tools.md#metamask).

### Required Prior Knowledge

This guide assumes you are familiar with [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Crypto_token)
in [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain),
[Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs)](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc)(also known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP))
, [NFTs](learn/protocols/stardust/core-concepts/multi-asset-ledger#non-fungible-tokens-nfts), [Smart Contracts](/learn/smart-contracts/introduction) and have
already tinkered with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/).
ERC20 is a standard for fungible tokens and is defined in
the [EIP-20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) by Ethereum.

## About ERC20

With the ERC20 standard, you can create your own tokens and transfer them to the EVM on IOTA Smart Contracts without
fees.

You can use the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy any regular Solidity Smart Contract.

Set the environment to `Injected Web3` and connect Remix with your MetaMask wallet.
If you haven’t already, please follow the instructions
on [how to connect your MetaMask with the public Testnet.](../getting-started/compatible-tools.md#metamask).

## 1. Create a Smart Contract

Create a new Solidity file, for example, `ERC20.sol` in the contracts folder of
your [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and add this code snippet:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract ExampleERC20Token is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("ExampleERC20Token", "EET") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

This imports all functions from the OpenZeppelin smart contract and creates a new ERC20 token with your name and Symbol.
OpenZeppelin provides many audited smart contracts and is a good point to start and learn.

You can change the token name `ExampleERC20Token` and the token symbol `EET`.

## 2. Compile Your Smart Contract

Go to the second tab and compile your smart contract with the **Compile ERC20.sol** button.

## 3. Deploy Your Smart Contract

1. Go to the next tab and select `Injected Web3` as your environment. Ensure that your MetaMask is installed and set up
   correctly.

2. Choose your ´ExampleERC20Token´ smart contract in the contract dropdown.

3. Press the "Deploy" button. Your MetaMask wallet will pop up, and you will need to accept the deployment.

4. Your MetaMask browser extension will open automatically - press **confirm**.

## 4. Add Your Token to MetaMask

1. Get the `contract address` from the transaction after the successful deployment. You can click on the latest
   transaction in your MetaMask Activity tab. If you have configured your MetaMask correctly,
   the [IOTA EVM Explorer](https://explorer.wasp.sc.iota.org/) will open the transaction.
2. Copy the contract address and import your token into MetaMask.

## 5. Have some Fun

Now you should see your token in MetaMask. You can send them to your friends without any fees or gas costs.

You also can ask in the [Discord Chat Server](https://discord.iota.org) to send them around and discover what the
community is building on IOTA Smart Contracts.
