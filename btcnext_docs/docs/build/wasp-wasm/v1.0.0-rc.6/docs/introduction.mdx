# Introduction to the Wasm VM for ISC

:::warning
The Wasm _VM_ is in experimental state, showcasing ISC's "VM plugin" architecture.

Experiment but avoid using it for production applications; opt for [EVM](/wasp-evm/introduction).
:::

:::caution

Smart Contracts are currently only compatible with the [Stardust protocol](/learn/protocols/stardust/introduction) and
therefore only compatible with the [Shimmer](/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmer) and
[Public Testnet networks](/build/networks-endpoints/#public-testnet).

:::

IOTA Smart Contracts (ISC) provide a sandboxed environment through an API, facilitating secure and deterministic interactions with ISC functions. This API supports any Virtual Machine (VM) aiming to build a system for smart contract code execution on ISC.

We offer a VM example utilizing [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) as a compilation target, facilitated by the open-source [Wasmtime runtime](https://wasmtime.dev/). This setup encourages dynamic smart contract operations compiled to Wasm code, promoting security and adaptability with different programming languages.

The Wasm VM operates with self-contained `WasmLib` libraries linked to individual Wasm codes, optimizing the ISC sandbox functionality and smart contract state storage access.

## Supported Functionalities

The ISC sandbox environment offers:

- Smart contract metadata and state data access
- Request data retrieval for function calls
- Token management within the contract
- Utility functions from the host
- Smooth initiation of other smart contract functions
- Logging facility

## Supported Languages

The WasmLib started with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) support, expanding to include [Go](https://golang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with the help of respective Wasm code generators:

| Language   | Wasm code generator                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Go         | [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/)                      |
| Rust       | [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) |
| TypeScript | [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/)  |

These generators maintain a common subset of their host language, aiming for a unified coding style to simplify the initiation into smart contract creation, welcoming developers with a C-style language background to quickly adapt.
