# Limit Access

You can define function access controls through the optional `access` subsection in the schema definition file.
By default, functions are accessible to everyone. However, when specified, the `access` identifier restricts who can
call a function.

## Access Identifiers

You can set access identifiers with **one** of the following options:

- `self`: Restricts access to the smart contract itself.
- `chain`: Allows only the chain owner to invoke the function.
- Other: Specify an AgentID or AgentID[] variable in state storage, controlling the agent(s) permitted to call the
  function.
  You should provide a mechanism to initialize and manage this variable.

The [Schema Tool](../schema-tool/usage.mdx) handles the auto-generation of the code for access verification.

## Usage Examples

You can find examples in the schema definition file where the `owner` state variable operates as an access identifier.
Functions such as `init` initialize the state variable, while `setOwner` can modify ownership,
enhancing the security by limiting function access to the current owner.

Remember to tailor access identifiers to individual functions as required,
and establish multiple identifiers if necessary.
