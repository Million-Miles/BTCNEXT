# Introduction

Smart contracts need robustness, combining both flexibility and stringent regulation to prevent mistakes and foster efficiency.
Using the Schema Tool ensures consistency, and simplifies smart contract development.

## Why Use the Schema Tool?

### Ensure Robustness and Consistency

By employing a code generator rooted in a schema definition file, you achieve:

- **Reliability**: Through debugged, trustworthy generated code.
- **Adaptability**: Facilitating modifications in the smart contract interface.
- **Intent Reflection**: Enforcing defined smart contract behavior at compile-time.
- **Multilingual Support**: Accommodating various programming languages.

### Prevent Repetitive Coding

Initial experiences illustrated repetitive coding in:

- `on_load` function setup and maintenance.
- Function access rights verification.
- Function parameter type and presence confirmation.
- Establishing access to State, Params, and Results maps.
- Common string constant definitions.

The schema tool diminishes redundancy and ensures up-to-date functionalities.

## The Schema Definition File

### Defining a Clear Interface

The schema definition file serves as a single source of truth, encompassing crucial details like:

- State Storage Variables.
- [Funcs and Views](../../explanations/context.mdx).
- [Access rights](access.mdx).
- [Input parameters](params.mdx) and [output results](results.mdx) .
- Additional Data Structures.

### Automation with Schema Tool

Using the [Schema Tool](usage.mdx), the file facilitates:

- **Skeleton Generation**: Crafting a smart contract framework that needs function implementations.
- **Interface Generation**: Creating interfaces to functions with stringent compile-time type-checking, thereby reducing errors.

## Benefits of Schema Tool in Smart Contracts

### Centralized Information

Having all pertinent details in one place allows:

- **Uniform Function Calls**: Through a generated interface used by client-side code.
- **Error Minimization**: Via compile-time type-checking.

### Efficiency and Simplicity

Knowledge of all essential aspects leads to:

- **Constant Generation**: Avoiding typo-prone key strings repetition and precalculating essential values like `Hnames`.
- **Informative Code**: Generating code to correctly notify the host about available `Funcs` and `Views`.
