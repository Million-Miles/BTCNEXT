# Send a Transaction

## Pre-requirements

Before you can create a transaction, you will need to:

- [Connect to a Node](simple.mdx).
- [Generate a seed](address.mdx#generate-a-seed).
- [Create an address](address.mdx#create-an-address).
- [Create a wallet](#create-a-walllet).
- [Request funds](#request-funds).
- [Fetch basic outputs](#fetch-basic-outputs).

### Create a Wallet

#### Create a wallet seed

You can create a wallet seed by instantiating an [Ed25519Seed](../references/client/classes/Ed25519Seed.md) using its constructor.
You will need to provide `secretBytes` to the constructor, which you can get by using the [Converter.hexToBytes(hex)](../references/util/classes/Converter.md#hextobytes) function.

#### Retrieve the wallet's address

Once you have [created your wallet seed](#create-a-wallet-seed), you can use it

Once you have [generated a seed](#generate-a-seed), you can create a wallet using the [Ed25519Address.toAddress()](../references/client/classes/Ed25519Address.md#toaddress) fucntion.

### Request Funds

Before you can send the transaction, you will need to request funds. If you are on the alphanet, you can request test
funds from the [faucet](https://faucet.alphanet.iotaledger.net/api/enqueue).

## Send the Transaction

Once you have fulfilled the [pre-requirements](#pre-requirements), you can send the transaction using either the [sendAdvanced(client, inputsAndSignatureKeyPairs, outputs, taggedData?)](../references/client/api_ref.md#sendadvanced) function, which will return the created block's id, or the [send(client, seed, accountIndex, addressBech32, amount, taggedData?, addressOptions?)](../references/client/api_ref.md#send) function, which will return the created block's id, as well as the constructed blocks.

As this example uses a genesis address, it must use the `(client, inputsAndSignatureKeyPairs, outputs, taggedData?)` function. However, if you are doing a wallet to wallet transfer, you can use the `send(client, seed, accountIndex, addressBech32, amount, taggedData?, addressOptions?)` method.

## Example Code

```ts reference
