# Manage Peers

## Pre-requirements

Before you can create add and retrieve peers, you will need to:

- [Connect to a Node](simple.mdx).

## Add Peers

You can add peers using the
[SingleNodeClient.peerAdd(multiAddress, alias?)](../references/client/classes/SingleNodeClient.md#peeradd) function.
You will need to provide a `multiAddress` and, optionally, and alias.

## Retrieve Peers

You can retrieve a [SingleNodeClient's](../references/client/classes/SingleNodeClient.md#peeradd) peers using the
[SingleNodeClient.peers()](../references/client/classes/SingleNodeClient.md#peers) function. The `peers()` function
will return a list of [peers](../references/client/interfaces/IPeer.md).

### Retrieve Peer Data

Once you have [retrieved your node's peers](#retrieve-peers), you can use any of its
[properties](../references/client/interfaces/IPeer.md#properties) to retrieve the peer's data.

## Delete Peers

You can delete a [SingleNodeClient's](../references/client/classes/SingleNodeClient.md#peeradd) peer using the
[SingleNodeClient.peerDelete(peerId)](../references/client/classes/SingleNodeClient.md#peerdelete) function. You will
need to provide a valid `peerId`.

## Example Code

```ts reference

```
