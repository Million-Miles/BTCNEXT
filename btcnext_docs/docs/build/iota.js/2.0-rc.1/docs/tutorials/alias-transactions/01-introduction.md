# Stardust for iota.js: Alias Transactions

This tutorial will get you acquainted with the structure and functionality of [Alias Transactions](/introduction/stardust/explanations/ledger/alias) in
IOTA's [Stardust protocol](/introduction/stardust/welcome) in
the [Shimmer network](https://shimmer.network) using [iota.js](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js) primitives to
issue transactions that involve Alias Output.

## Introduction

Starting from [Chrysalis](/learn/protocols/chrysalis/introduction), IOTA is
a [UTXO-based (Unspent Transaction Output)](/learn/protocols/chrysalis/core-concepts/switch-to-UTXO)
Ledger. Each UTXO, also known as **output**, has an associated number of tokens that determines its value.
Thus, the permanent data on the ledger is composed of a set of records (_outputs_) that can be unlocked by the owner of
its associated address, i.e., the one who knows the address' private key.

There are different [output types](/tips/tips/TIP-0018#output-design). This tutorial series will only focus on
**Alias Outputs** known as [`IAliasOutput`](./../../references/client/interfaces/IAliasOutput.md). Alias Outputs are
generated by transactions that unlock and consume already existing outputs. When a transaction consumes them, these
outputs turn into inputs and generate new outputs, typically another Alias Output with the same Alias ID but in a different state. At pruning time, _consumed outputs_ will be removed by Nodes.

## Storage Costs and Deposits

You need to take into account that Alias Output as any other UTXOs need to be stored by [Hornet Nodes](/hornet/welcome), so there is a [storage cost](/iota.js/tutorials/value-transactions/introduction#storage-costs-and-deposits).
