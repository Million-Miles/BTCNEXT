# Stardust for iota.js: NFT Transactions

This tutorial will get you acquainted with the structure and functionality of [NFT Transactions](/learn/protocols/stardust/core-concepts/multi-asset-ledger#non-fungible-tokens-nfts) in
IOTA's [Stardust protocol](/introduction/welcome) in
the [Shimmer network](https://shimmer.network) using [iota.js](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js) primitives to
issue transactions that involve NFT Output.

## Introduction

Starting from [Chrysalis](/introduction/welcome), IOTA is
a [UTXO-based (Unspent Transaction Output)](/introduction/reference/details#unspent-transaction-output-utxo)
Ledger. Each UTXO, also known as **Output**, has an associated number of tokens that determines its value.
Thus, the permanent data on the ledger is composed of a set of records (_Outputs_) that can be unlocked by the owner of
its associated address, i.e., the one who knows the address' private key.

There are different [output types](/tips/tips/TIP-0018#output-design). This tutorial series will only focus on
**NFT Outputs** known as [`INftOutput`](./../../references/client/interfaces/INftOutput.md). NFT Outputs are
generated by transactions that unlock and consume already existing Outputs. When a transaction consumes them, these
Outputs turn into Inputs and generate new Outputs, typically another NFT Output with the same NFT ID but in a different state. At pruning time, _consumed Outputs_ will be removed by Nodes.

## Storage Costs and Deposits

You need to take into account that NFT Output, as any other UTXOs, need to be stored by [Hornet Nodes](/hornet/welcome), so there is a [storage cost](/iota.js/tutorials/value-transactions/introduction#storage-costs-and-deposits).
