# Overview

The IOTA Streams framework is intended to be a secure message verification and protection protocol
for sending data over a given transport layer.

The Channels protocol is designed as a replacement for the previously used MAM library for sending
data using the Tangle as the primary transportation mechanism. The channels themselves can be
structured in a number of ways with any arbitrary combination of publishers and subscribers (although
each channel can only be hosted by a single author instance)

# Channels Protocol

The Channels protocol provides the high level API tools necessary for authors and subscribers to be
generated and interact with the Tangle.

## Authors

A channel author is responsible for the generation of a new channel along with the configuration of the
intended structure of that channel (i.e single branch vs multi branch). An author of a channel will be
able to set the access restrictions to branches within a channel structure, as well as accepting and
managing user subscription messages.

## Subscribers

A channel subscriber is any user within a channel that is not the author. A subscriber can be generated
independently without verification by an author, but in order to write to a branch, or to process any
private streams, they will be required to subscribe to the channel, and have the author accept and process
that subscription. A subscriber may also use pre-shared keys instead of subscription as a method of
interacting with a stream without conducting a subscription process.

## Branching

Branches can be defined as any sequential grouping of messages that are linked to the announcement
message. These branches will typically be generated with either a signed packet message or a keyload message for
public and private streaming respectively. A channel can assume two different forms:

- Single branch: a linear sequencing of messages (similar to a MAM stream) with each message linked to
  the previous one.
- Multi branch: a sequencing of messages that does not rely on sequential linking of messages.

When generating a channel, the author will decide whether the channel will use single branching or multi-
branching, this will inform the Streams instance in which way it should perform sequencing. subscribers will
also be informed as they process the announcement message, so their instances know the appropriate
sequencing order as well.

## Keyloads

A keyload message is an access restriction and control message that allows the author to specify who should be
able to decrypt any messages that are attached following it. There are two ways to specify access when generating
a keyload message:

- Subscriber public keys
- Pre-shared keys

### Public Keys

During the processing of subscription messages, public keys are masked and provided to the author to be stored on
their instance. That author can then specify which of these users will be able to access subsequent messages by
including that public key in the keyload message.

### Pre-Shared Keys

A predefined key shared amongst users by other means then the subscription process above. These keys can be used to provide access restrictions to a stream
without the need for a subscription process.

:::note

The security and transportation of these pre-shared keys must be ensured by the user implementations.

## Sequencing

Sequencing is the methodology built within streams to allow message identifiers to be sequentially generated regardless
of the shape of the channel. Messages are identified by an indexation position within the Tangle, and they are
generated using a combination of these pieces of information:

- Application instance (channel identifier).
- Public key of the publisher.
- Previous message id (The message being linked to).
- Branch number (identifier for the specific branch).
- Sequencing number (the sequencing position of the publisher).

As messages are posted to and read from the channel, a local state for the user implementation will update with the message
identifier, branch and sequencing numbers for each publishing party. This allows user implementations to derive and
search for the next message in the sequence to keep in sync.

### Single Branch Sequencing

In a single branch implementation, sequencing state of each user will be updated to the same state. This means that
regardless of the publisher, the state of each user will update the previous message id to the new message link, and the
sequencing number will be incremented by one.

Sequence states before Msg1 is sent:

```
               Author        Sub1
Prev Msg Id     Msg0         Msg0
Branch No.        0            0
Seq. No.          2            2       <- Users start from 2, 0 and 1 are reserved for subscriptions and announcements
```

Msg1 is then sent by the author using the above stated author state.

Sequence states after Msg1 is sent:

```
               Author        Sub1
Prev Msg Id     Msg1         Msg1
Branch No.        0            0
Seq. No.          3            3
```

:::note

It is recommended that a single branch be used with only a single publisher to avoid out of sync parties from
issuing and retrieving messages from an incorrect sequencing combination (i.e. Sub1 sends a message linked to Msg1 and Sub2
sends a message linked to that same Msg1 before seeing and registering the message from Sub1, thus forking the stream).
Multiple publishers can be used, but it is important to ensure that they do not try to send messages in parallel to
avoid this conflict. In the future this may be an enforced limitation on single branch implementations to remove the
possibility altogether.

### Multi Branch Sequencing

In a multi branch implementation, the sequencing state of each user will be updated independently after each message is sent.
In order to track the linking of messages of individual publishers within a tree-like structure, a secondary message is
sent in tandem with every data message. This message is called a sequencing message, and contains the essence necessary
for a user to derive the correct message id of a sequenced message. The sequencing messages are issued to an anchored
branch generated during the creation of the channel. As a new message is generated by a user, a sequencing message is
issued to this anchored branch to allow users a reference guide to the location of the issued data packet.
