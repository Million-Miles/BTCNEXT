Sending value-based messages is a very straightforward process if you use the
[`MessageSender`](./../api_reference.md#messagesender) helper class. You will only need to provide a valid
seed by chaining a call to [`.seed(seed: string)`](./../api_reference.md#seedseed-messagesender), and an
output address and amount by chaining a call to
[`.output(address: string, amount: string)`](./../api_reference.md#outputaddress-amount-messagesender). The
method will find valid output(s) that can be used to fund the given amount(s) and the unspent amount will be sent to the
same address.
