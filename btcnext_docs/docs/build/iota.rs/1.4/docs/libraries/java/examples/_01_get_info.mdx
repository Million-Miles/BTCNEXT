**Output example** of the [`getInfo()`](./../api_reference.md#getinfo-nodeinfowrapper) function of the
[`Client`](./../api_reference.md#client) instance:

<GetInfoOutput />

<LoadBalancerHealthChecks />

<ClientBuilder />

The most common ones are:

- `.withNetwork(string)`: Can be either `devnet` or `mainnet`. It instructs
  the library whether to automatically select devnet nodes or mainnet nodes.
- `.withNode(string)`: Specify address of actual running IOTA node that should be used
  to communicate with in the format `https://node:port`). For example: `https://api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe:443`.
- `.withNodePoolUrls(String[])`: The library also supports managing a pool of
  nodes. You can provide a list of nodes and the library manages the access to them automatically by selecting them based
  on their sync status. If you provide `.withNodePoolUrls(String[])`, then the library periodically will periodically
  check
  whether node is in sync or
  not by calling `.withNodeSyncInterval(float)`.
- `.withLocalPow(boolean)`: If `.localPow (True)` a Proof-of-work will be done
  locally and not remotely.
- `.withNodeSyncDisabled()`: When called, the library will use nodes that
  are **not** in sync with network. This parameter is usually useful if you would like to interact with a local test node
  that is not fully synced. **This parameter should not be used in production**.
