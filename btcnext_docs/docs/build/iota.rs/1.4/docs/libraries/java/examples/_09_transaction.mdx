Sending value-based messages is a very straightforward process if you use the
[`ClientMessageBuilder`](./../api_reference.md#clientmessagebuilder) helper class. You will only need to
provide a valid seed by chaining a call to
[`.withSeed(seed: String)`](./../api_reference.md#withseedseed-clientmessagebuilder), and output addresses
and amount by chaining a call to
[`withOutput(address: String, amount: long):`](./../api_reference.md#withoutputaddress-amount-clientmessagebuilder).
The method will find valid output(s) that can be used to fund the given amount(s) and the unspent amount will be sent to
the same address.
