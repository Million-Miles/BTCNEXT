**Output example** of the `get_info()` function of the `Client` class:

<GetInfoOutput />

<LoadBalancerHealthChecks />

The `Client` class constructor provides several parameters via which the process can be closely managed.

The most common ones are:

- `network`: Can be either `devnet` or `mainnet`. It instructs the library whether to automatically select devnet
  nodes or mainnet nodes.
- `node`: Specify address of actual running IOTA node that should be used to communicate with in the format
  `https://node:port`). For example: `https://api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe:443`.
- `node_pool_urls`: The library also supports managing a pool of nodes. You can provide a list of nodes and the
  library manages the access to them automatically by selecting them based on their sync status. If you provide
  `node_pool_urls`, then the library periodically will periodically check whether node is in sync or not by calling
  `.node_sync_interval`.
- `local_pow`: If `local_pow==True` (default value) a Proof-of-work will be done locally and not remotely.
- `node_sync_disabled`: When called, the library will use nodes that are **not** in sync with network. This
  parameter is usually useful if you would like to interact with a local test node that is not fully synced. **This
  parameter should not be used in production**.
