There are three common API calls you can use to get a balance:

## [`Client.get_address_balance(address: str)`](./../api_reference.md#get_address_balanceaddress-balanceaddressresponse)

Expects a single address in Bech32 format and returns `dict` with a balance for the address.

## [`Client.get_address_balances(addresses: list[str])`](./../api_reference.md#get_address_balancesaddresses-listaddressbalancepair)

A convenient function that expects `list` of addresses in Bech32 format and returns list of `dict` with balances for all given addresses

## [`Client.get_balance(seed, account_index (optional), initial_address_index(optional), gap_limit(optional))`](./../api_reference.md#get_balanceseed-account_index-optional-initial_address_indexoptional-gap_limitoptional-int)

A convenient function that combines `Client.get_addresses()` and `Client.get_address_balances()` api calls. It returns a combined balance for the provided `seed` and optional chaining calls `.accountIndex(index)`, `.initialAddressIndex(index)` and `.gapLimit(amount)`

`Client.get_balance(seed)` performs several tasks under the hood. It starts by generating addresses for the provided
`seed` and `account_index` from `initial_address_index`, and checks for a balance of each of the generated
addresses. Since it does not know how many addresses are used in fact, there is a condition set by the
`gap_limit` argument to know when to stop searching. If the `gap_limit` amount of addresses in a row have no
balance, the function returns results and stops searching.

```

Example of output:

```json
{
   "address":"atoi1qp9427varyc05py79ajku89xarfgkj74tpel5egr9y7xu3wpfc4lkpx0l86",
   "balance":10000000,
   "dustAllowed":false
}
Account balance: 0
```

- `dustAllowed` indicates whether the given address is allowed to accept a dust due to
  [dust protection mechanism](/introduction/explanations/faq#what-is-dust-protection-and-how-does-it-work).
