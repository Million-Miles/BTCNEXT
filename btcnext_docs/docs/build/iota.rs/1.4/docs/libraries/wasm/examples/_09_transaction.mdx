Sending value-based messages is a very straightforward process if you use the
[`MessageBuilder`](./../api_reference.md#messagebuilder) helper class. You will only need to provide a valid seed by chaining a call to
[`.seed(seed: string)`](./../api_reference.md#messagebuilderseedseed--codemessagebuildercode) and
an output address and amount by chaining a call to [`.output(address: string, amount: BigInt)`](./../api_reference.md#messagebuilderoutputaddress-amount--codemessagebuildercode). The method will find valid
output(s) that can be used to fund the given amount(s) and the unspent amount will be sent to the same address.
