There are two API calls you can use to get a balance:

## [`Client.getAddressBalances(addresses: any)`](./../api_reference.md#Client+getAddressBalances)

A convenient function that expects `list` of addresses in Bech32 format and returns list of `dict` with balances for all
given addresses.

## [`Client.getBalance(seed: string)`](./../api_reference.md#Client+getBalance)

A convenient helper [`BalanceGetter`](./../api_reference.md#BalanceGetter) class that combines
[`Client.getAddresses(seed: string)`](./../api_reference.md#Client+getAddresses) and
`Client.getAddressBalances()` api calls. It returns a combined balance for the provided `seed` and optional chaining
calls [`.accountIndex(index)`](./../api_reference.md#BalanceGetter+accountIndex),
[`.initialAddressIndex(initial_address_index: number)`](./../api_reference.md#balancegetterinitialaddressindexinitial_address_index--codebalancegettercode)
and
[`.gap_limit(amount: number)`](./../api_reference.md#balancegettergap_limitgap_limit--codebalancegettercode)

`Client.getBalance(seed: string)` performs several tasks under the hood. It starts by generating addresses for the
provided `seed` and `.accountIndex` from
[`.initialAddressIndex(initial_address_index: number)`](./../api_reference.md#BalanceGetter+initialAddressIndex),
and checks for a balance of each of the generated addresses. Since it does not know how many addresses are used in fact,
there is a condition set by the
[`.gap_limit(amount: number)`](./../api_reference.md#BalanceGetter+gap_limit) argument to know when to stop
searching. If the `.gap_limit` amount of addresses in a row have no balance, the function returns results and searching
does not continue.

Example of output:

```json
{
   "address":"atoi1qp9427varyc05py79ajku89xarfgkj74tpel5egr9y7xu3wpfc4lkpx0l86",
   "balance":10000000,
   "dustAllowed":false,
   "ledgerIndex": 2338924
}
Account balance: 0
```

- `dustAllowed` indicates whether the given address is allowed to accept a dust. You can learn more about dust
  protection in the
  [Chrysalis documentation](/introduction/explanations/faq#what-is-dust-protection-and-how-does-it-work).
