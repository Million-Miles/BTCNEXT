# API Reference

API reference

You can find the [API reference](https://docs.rs/iota-client) in [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/), or generate it yourself.

If you would like to explore the implementation in more depth, the following command generates docs for the whole crate, including private modules:

```bash
cargo doc --document-private-items --no-deps --open
```
