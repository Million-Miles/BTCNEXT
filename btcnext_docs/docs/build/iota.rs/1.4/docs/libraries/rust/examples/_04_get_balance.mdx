There are several API calls you can use to get a balance:

## [`Client. get_address_balances(addresses: &[String])`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/client/struct.Client.html#method.get_address_balances)

Aconvenient function that expects `list` of addresses in Bech32 format and returns list of `dict` with balances for all
given addresses.

## [`Client.get_balance(seed: seed: &'a Seed)`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/client/struct.Client.html#method.get_balance)

A convenient [`GetBalanceBuilder`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/api/struct.GetBalanceBuilder.html#)
class that combines
[`Client.get_addresses(seed: &'a Seed)`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/client/struct.Client.html#method.get_addresses)
and
[`Client.get_address_balances(addresses: &[String])`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/client/struct.Client.html#method.get_address_balances)
api calls. It returns a combined balance for the provided `seed` and optional chaining calls
[`.with_account_index(account_index: usize)`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/api/struct.GetBalanceBuilder.html#method.with_account_index),
[`.with_initial_address_index(initial_address_index: usize)`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/api/struct.GetBalanceBuilder.html#method.with_initial_address_index)
and
[`.with_gap_limit(gap_limit: usize)`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/api/struct.GetBalanceBuilder.html#method.with_gap_limit).

`Client.get_balance(seed)` performs several tasks under the hood. It starts by generating addresses for the provided
`seed` and `.account_index` from `.with_initial_address_index(account_index)`, and checks for a balance of each of the
generated addresses. Since it does not know how many addresses are used in fact, there is a condition set by the
`.with_gap_limit(gap_limit)` argument to know when to stop searching. If the `.gap_limit` amount of addresses in a row
have no balance, the function returns results and searching does not continue.

## [`Client.get_address().balance(address: &str)`](./../api_reference.md#balanceaddress-balanceaddressresponse)

You can use the [`GetAdressBuilder`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/node/struct.GetAddressBuilder.html)
on a `Client` instance and query for an addresses' balances by chaining a call to the `balance(address: String)`
function.

## [`Client.get_address().outputs(address: &str, options: OutputOptions)`](./../api_reference.md#balanceaddress-balanceaddressresponse)

You can use the [`GetAdressBuilder`](https://docs.rs/iota-client/latest/iota_client/node/struct.GetAddressBuilder.html)
on a `Client` instance and query for an addresses' balances by chaining a call to the `outputs(address: String)`
function.

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/tree/production/examples/04_get_balance.rs
```

Example of output:

```json
Account balance: 1096055332i

The balance of "atoi1qzt0nhsf38nh6rs4p6zs5knqp6psgha9wsv74uajqgjmwc75ugupx3y7x0r" is 451055332i

The outputs of address "atoi1qzt0nhsf38nh6rs4p6zs5knqp6psgha9wsv74uajqgjmwc75ugupx3y7x0r" are: [
  UtxoInput(741673db85f78ebd95d04b572d1bf32e9207bbd265d90dbbe499a6d32f2b25470000),
  UtxoInput(ed33089c623c67eb06dbc1c10b0c1c0424b0ace04a2e44070702668b3de440c80000),
  UtxoInput(0af84c860dc461730064e7c4c88152ed8bea1ae72b1d6f5e4ab0c3e51ed185b70100),
  ...]
```

- `dustAllowed` indicates whether the given address is allowed to accept a dust due to
  [dust protection mechanism](/introduction/explanations/faq#what-is-dust-protection-and-how-does-it-work).
