# Seeds

Since the IOTA network is permission-less, anybody is able to use it and interact with it. No central authority is
required at any stage. So anybody is able to generate their own `seed` and then deterministically generate the
respective private keys/addresses.

IOTA uses the `Ed25519` signature scheme and addresses are usually represented by Bech32 (checksummed base32) format
string of 64 characters.

A root of the `Ed25519` signature scheme is basically a `32-byte (256-bit)` uniformly randomly generated seed on which
all private keys and corresponding addresses are generated. In the examples below, the seed is represented by a string
of 64 characters using the `[0-9a-f]` alphabet (32 bytes encoded in hexadecimal).
