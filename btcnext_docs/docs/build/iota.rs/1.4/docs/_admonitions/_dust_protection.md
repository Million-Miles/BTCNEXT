:::note Dust Protection

Due to the [dust protection](/introduction/explanations/faq#what-is-dust-protection-and-how-does-it-work)
mechanism implemented in the network protocol, microtransactions below 1Mi of IOTA tokens can only be sent to another
address if there is already at least 1Mi on that address

That's why the code in the example sent 1Mi, to comply with the protection.
