:::info Seed Mnemonics/Phrases

In modern wallet implementations such as the [wallet.rs library](/wallet.rs/welcome) and the
[firefly wallet](https://blog.iota.org/firefly-beta-release/), the seed is usually generated from a `seed mnemonic`
(`seed phrase`), using [BIP39 standard](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0039), to be better memorized/stored by humans.
It is based on a randomly generated list of english words and later used to generate the seed. The seed is a root for
all generated private keys and addresses.
