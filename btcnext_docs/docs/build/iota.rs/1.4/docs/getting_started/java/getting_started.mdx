# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To use the library, we recommend you update Rust to the latest stable version [`$ rustup update stable`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date). Nightly should be fine but some changes might not be compatible.

Ensure you have first installed the required dependencies for the library [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/blob/dev/README.md). Then also install the following programs:

- Java & JDK (Make sure $JAVA_HOME env variable) is set
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) v4 or higher or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installe
- Cargo ndk (`cargo install cargo-ndk`)
- Cargo fmt (`rustup component add rustfmt`)

Download or clone the `iota.rs` repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs.git
```

## Installation

To build using the iota.rs Java bindings, you need the following two parts:

1. JNI Native library linking `Rust` to `C`, and then `C` to java `native` methods (`.so` , `.dll` or `.dylib` depending on your system).
2. Java archive(Jar) containing `native` methods which call C code. (`.jar`).

### Step 1: Creating the Native Library

Build the iota.rs library (This generates the java source code and JNI library file)

```bash
cd iota.rs/bindings/java
cargo build --release
```

Generated binaries can then be found at `iota.rs/bindings/java/target/release`

### Step 2: Creating the Java archive

#### Generating the source files and classes

After step 1, Java source files will be generated under `iota.rs/bindings/java/native/src/main/java/org/iota/client`.

If this step succeeded, we need to generate the jar file containing the newly generated Java source files.

#### Generating the jar

Generating the jar can be done with your tool of preference. We provide examples for Gradle and Maven in this guide

##### Gradle

Make `gradlew` executable (`chmod +x gradlew`) if needed, then run

```bash
cd iota.rs/bindings/java
./gradlew jar
```

##### Maven

```bash
cd iota.rs/bindings/java
mvn install
```

After running one of these commands, the jar can then be found at `iota.rs/bindings/java/native/build/libs/native.jar`

## Usage

You can find more information on using the `iota.rs` library's java binding in the [examples section](./../../examples/running_examples.mdx).

### Gradle

```bash
./gradlew examples:java-app:test --info
```

### Maven

```bash
mvn exec:exec
```

## Initialisation

This example fetches node information

```java
private static void nodeInfo() {
    String nodeUrl = "https://chrysalis-nodes.iota.cafe:443";
    Client iota = Client.Builder()
        // Insert your node URL here
        .withNode(nodeUrl)
        // Choose pow mode
        .withLocalPow(true)
        //Then create the Client instance
        .finish();
    NodeInfoWrapper info = iota.getInfo();
    System.out.println("Node url: " + info.url());
    System.out.println("Node Info: " + info.nodeInfo());
}
```

## API Reference

Java

### Limitations

Due to the fact that we are linking through C from Rust, there are a couple of limiting factors.

- Classic builder patterns return a `clone` after each builder call since we can only pass back to C by reference in `Rust`

```Java
Builder builder1 = new Builder();
Builder builder2 = builder1.setValue(true);

// These are different instances, thus builder1 wont have the value set
assertNotEquals(builder1, builder2);
```
