# Getting Started With Node.js

## Requirements

Before you can get started with the Node.js binding for the iota.rs client library, please make sure that you have
installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/),
[Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Installing the Library

### NPM

If you are using NPM, you can install the binding in your project by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @iota/client
```

### Yarn

If you are using Yarn, you can install the binding in your project by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add @iota/client
```

## Using the Library

The following example shows you how to include the library and connect to a devnet node.

```javascript
const { ClientBuilder } = require('@iota/client');
const client = new ClientBuilder()
  .node('https://api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe')
  .build();
client.getInfo().then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```
