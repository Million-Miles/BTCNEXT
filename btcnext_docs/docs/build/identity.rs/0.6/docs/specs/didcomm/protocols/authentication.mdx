The IOTA DIDComm Specification is in the RFC phase and may undergo changes. Suggestions are welcome at [GitHub #464](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/discussions/464).

:::

- Version: 0.1
- Status: `IN-PROGRESS`
- Last Updated: 2021-10-29

## Overview

This protocol allows two parties to mutually authenticate by disclosing and verifying the [DID] of each other. On successful completion of this protocol, it is expected that [sender authenticated encryption][sae] may be used between the parties for continuous authentication.

### Relationships

- [Connection](./connection.mdx): it is RECOMMENDED to establish [anonymous encryption](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#anonymous-encryption) on [connection](./connection.mdx) to prevent revealing the DID of either party to eavesdroppers.

### Example Use-Cases

- A connected sensor wants to make sure only valid well-known parties connect to it, before allowing access.
- A customer wants to make sure they are actually connecting to their bank, before presenting information.
- An organisation wants to verify the DID of the employer before issuing access credentials.

### Roles

- Requester: initiates the authentication.
- Responder: responds to the authentication request.

## Messages

### 1. authentication-request {#authentication-request}

- Type: `iota/authentication/0.1/authentication-request`
- Role: [requester](#roles)

Sent to initiate the authentication process. This MUST be a [signed DIDComm message][sdm] to provide some level of trust to the [responder](#roles). However, even when signed it is possible to replay an [authentication-request](#authentication-request), so this message alone is insufficient to prove the DID of the [requester](#roles). In addition to a unique `requesterChallenge`, the `created_time` and `expires_time` [DIDComm message headers](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#message-headers) SHOULD be used to mitigate such replay attacks. Note that even a successful replay would only reveal the DID of the responder, authentication of a malicious requester will still fail without access to the original requester's private keys due to the use of challenges.

#### Structure

```json
{
  "did": DID,                   // REQUIRED
  "requesterChallenge": string, // REQUIRED
  "upgradeEncryption": string,  // REQUIRED
}
```

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                        | Required |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| [`did`][did]         | [DID] of the [requester](#roles).[^1]                                                                                                                              | ✔        |
| `requesterChallenge` | A random string unique per [authentication-request](#authentication-request) by a [requester](#roles) to help mitigate replay attacks.                             | ✔        |
| `upgradeEncryption`  | A string indicating whether [sender authenticated encryption][sae] should be used in the following messages. One of `["required", "optional", "unsupported"]`.[^2] | ✔        |

[^1] The signing key used for the [signed DIDComm envelope][sdm] wrapping this message MUST be an [authentication method][auth_method] in the DID document corresponding to `did`, as per the [DIDComm specification][didcomm_keys].

[^2] The `upgradeEncryption` field allows negotiation of whether or not to use [sender authenticated encryption][sae] for the [authentication](#authentication) protocol and for all messages that follow it. It is RECOMMENDED to specify `"required"` as it offers various guarantees of continuous authentication and payload _integrity_ for every message. The available options are:

- `"required"`: the [responder](#roles) MUST initiate [sender authenticated encryption][sae], from the following [authentication-response](#authentication-response) message onwards, or send a problem-report.
- `"optional"`: the [responder](#roles) chooses whether or not to use [sender authenticated encryption][sae].
- `"unsupported"`: the [responder](#roles) MUST NOT use [sender authenticated encryption][sae]. A [responder](#roles) MAY reject [authentication-requests](#authentication-request) that do not support encryption.
  Any other value for `upgradeEncryption` is invalid and should result in an invalid-request problem-report.

#### Examples

1. Request payload requiring encryption:

```json
{
  "did": "did:iota:9rK6DPF46MCEzgfLD8AHFsaTuMqvmRo6kbXfjqQJPJmC",
  "requesterChallenge": "81285532-b72a-4a99-a9bd-b470475bc24f",
  "upgradeEncryption": "required"
}
```

### 2. authentication-response {#authentication-response}

- Type: `iota/authentication/0.1/authentication-response`
- Role: [responder](#roles)

Sent in response to an [authentication-request](#authentication-request), proving the DID of the [responder](#roles). Optionally establishes [sender authenticated encryption][sae] based on the value of `upgradeEncryption` in the preceding [authentication-request](#authentication-request). If `upgradeEncryption` was `"required"` and this message is not encrypted, or `"unsupported"` and this message is encrypted, the [requester](#roles) MUST issue a problem-report and abort the authentication.

This message MUST be a [signed DIDComm message][sdm], even if [sender authenticated encryption][sae] is used. This is to ensure an [authentication key][auth_method] is used to sign the challenge, in accordance with the [DID specification][auth_method], and because there may be increased security controls or guarantees compared to the [keyAgreement](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#key-agreement) keys used for [sender authenticated encryption][sae].

#### Structure

```json
{
  "did": DID,                   // REQUIRED
  "requesterChallenge": string, // REQUIRED
  "responderChallenge": string, // REQUIRED
}
```

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                              | Required |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| [`did`][did]         | [DID] of the [responder](#roles).[^1]                                                                                                    | ✔        |
| `requesterChallenge` | Must match the `requesterChallenge` in the preceding [authentication-request](#authentication-request).                                  | ✔        |
| `responderChallenge` | A random string unique per [authentication-response](#authentication-response) by a [responder](#roles) to help mitigate replay attacks. | ✔        |

[^1] The signing key used for the [signed DIDComm envelope][sdm] wrapping this message MUST be an [authentication method][auth_method] in the DID document corresponding to the `did`, as per the [DIDComm specification][didcomm_keys].

#### Examples

1. Responder presenting their [DID] and offering a challenge to the requester:

```json
{
  "did": "did:iota:8cU6DPF56MDEugfLF8AHFaaTuMQvmRo6kbxfjqQJpJmC",
  "requesterChallenge": "81285532-b72a-4a99-a9bd-b470475bc24f",
  "responderChallenge": "b1f0dc02-85a3-4438-8786-b625f11f1be4"
}
```

### 3. authentication-result {#authentication-result}

- Type: `iota/authentication/0.1/authentication-result`
- Role: [requester](#roles)

This message finalises the mutual authentication, proving control over the DID of the [requester](#roles) to the [responder](#roles). Similar to [authentication-response](#authentication-response), this message MUST be a [signed DIDComm message][sdm].

This MUST or MUST NOT use [sender authenticated encryption][sae] depending on the outcome of the `upgradeEncryption` negotiation in the preceding [authentication-response](#authentication-response) message, otherwise resulting in a problem-report and failure of the authentication protocol. For example, if `upgradeEncryption` was `optional` and the [authentication-response](#authentication-response) used [sender authenticated encryption][sae], then the [authentication-result](#authentication-result) MUST be encrypted to be valid.

#### Structure

```json
{
  "responderChallenge": string // REQUIRED
}
```

| Field                | Description                                                                                          | Required |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `responderChallenge` | Must match the `challenge` in the preceding [authentication-response](#authentication-response).[^1] | ✔        |

[^1] The signing key used for the [signed DIDComm envelope][sdm] wrapping this message MUST be an [authentication method][auth_method] in the DID document corresponding to the `did` of the [requester](#roles) in the [authentication-request](#authentication-request), as per the [DIDComm specification][didcomm_keys].

#### Examples

1. Requester responding with the responder's challenge from the previous message:

```json
{
  "responderChallenge": "0768e82d-f498-4f38-8686-918325f9560d"
}
```

### Problem Reports {#problem-reports}

The following problem-report codes may be raised in the course of this protocol and are expected to be recognised and handled in addition to any general problem-reports. Implementers may also introduce their own application-specific problem-reports.

For guidance on problem-reports and a list of general codes see [problem reports](../resources/problem-reports.mdx).

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `e.p.msg.iota.authentication.reject-authentication`                       | [authentication-request](#authentication-request), [authentication-response](#authentication-response), [authentication-result](#authentication-result) | The party rejects an authentication request/response/result for any reason.                                                                 |
| `e.p.msg.iota.authentication.reject-authentication.missing-keys`          | [authentication-request](#authentication-request), [authentication-response](#authentication-response), [authentication-result](#authentication-result) | The party rejects an authentication request/response due to the other party lacking a supported `keyAgreement` section in the DID document. |
| `e.p.msg.iota.authentication.reject-authentication.untrusted-identity`    | [authentication-request](#authentication-request), [authentication-response](#authentication-response)                                                  | The party rejects an authentication request/response due to the claimed DID of the other party.                                             |
| `e.p.msg.iota.authentication.reject-authentication.encyption-required`    | [authentication-request](#authentication-request), [authentication-response](#authentication-response), [authentication-result](#authentication-result) | The party rejects an authentication request/response/result due to the lack of [sender authenticated encryption][sae].                      |
| `e.p.msg.iota.authentication.reject-authentication.encyption-unsupported` | [authentication-request](#authentication-request), [authentication-response](#authentication-response), [authentication-result](#authentication-result) | The party rejects an authentication request/response/result because it does not support [sender authenticated encryption][sae].             |

## Considerations

This section is non-normative.

- **Trust**: this [authentication](#authentication) protocol only verifies that both parties have access to the necessary private keys (which could become compromised) associated with their DID documents. Verifying whether a DID document is [bound to a physical identity](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#binding-to-physical-identity) may require additional interactions. Verifying whether a DID can be trusted can be achieved by, for instance:
  - requesting a verifiable presentation of credentials issued by a trusted third party, such as a government,
  - using the [Well Known DID Configuration](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/) or embedding the DID in a DNS record to tie an identity to a website or domain,
  - using an allowlist of trusted DIDs,
  - exchanging DIDs out-of-band in a secure manner (note that some [connection](./connection.mdx) invitations could be altered by malicious parties depending on the medium).
- **Authorisation**: the permissions and capabilities of either party may still need to be established after [authentication](#authentication), either by [verifiable presentation](./presentation.mdx) as mentioned above or other methods such as JWT tokens
- **Privacy**: the [responder](#roles) may be subject to probing whereby their DID may be revealed even with the use of [sender authenticated encryption][sae], as the `skid` message header is linked to their DID. This is possible if the [responder](#roles) chooses to accept the [authentication-request](#authentication-request) of an unknown [requester](#roles), or the [requester](#roles) successfully replays an [authentication-request](#authentication-request) from a DID the [requester](#roles) trusts.

## Unresolved Questions

- Enforce signed DIDComm messages on top of sender-authenticated encryption or keep them optional? Usually unnecessary and DIDComm recommends against this since it's redundant and due to non-repudiation may decrease security and privacy by allowing participants to prove to third parties that authentication occurred.
