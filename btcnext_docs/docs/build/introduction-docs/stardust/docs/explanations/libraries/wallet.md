# IOTA Wallet Library

:::warning Deprecated

The IOTA client libraries have been deprecated and replaced by the [IOTA SDK](/iota-sdk/welcome).

:::

The wallet library is a stateful library for developers; essentially, it's a programmable wallet. However, if you use IOTA or Shimmer to transfer tokens, you should use this library as its stateful design supports the handling and monitoring of multiple accounts and addresses.

It also supports the [Stronghold.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs) enclave, incorporating the best security practices in one package. You can read more about the [IOTA Wallet Library documentation in our wiki](/wallet.rs/1.0-rc.6/welcome).
