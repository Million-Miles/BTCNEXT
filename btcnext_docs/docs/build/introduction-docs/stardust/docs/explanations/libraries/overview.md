# Libraries

:::warning Deprecated

The IOTA client libraries have been deprecated and replaced by the [IOTA SDK](/iota-sdk/welcome).

:::

**With the IOTA client libraries you can easily integrate IOTA and Shimmer into your own applications. You can choose a library to match your use case.**

The official IOTA libraries serve as `one-source-code-of-truth` to IOTA users and provide binding to other programming languages. Below is a list of the IOTA libraries. You can also check out the [IOTA client libraries blog post](https://blog.iota.org/the-new-iota-client-libraries-harder-better-faster-stronger/), to learn about the libraries' core principles.

- [IOTA SDK](/iota-sdk/welcome): The IOTA SDK replaces `iota.rs`, `iota.js` and `wallet.rs` with a convenient development kit, written
  in [Rust](/iota-sdk/getting-started/rust), with bindings for
  [Node.js](/iota-sdk/getting-started/nodejs),
  [Python](/iota-sdk/getting-started/python), and [Wasm](/iota-sdk/getting-started/wasm).
- [iota.go](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/tree/v3): an IOTA client library in Golang.
- [iota.c](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.c/tree/develop): a special-purpose library in C for embedded devices (with microcontrollers) covering a basic features of `client-lib` or `wallet-lib.`

![Libraries Overview](/img/stardust_explanations/libraries/overview/libraries.svg)

Currently, all of the libraries are in active development. The `develop` version of libraries target the Shimmer network and no longer work with the current IOTA Mainnet.

The IOTA foundation is in charge of maintaining the official client libraries. You can find the libraries' source code in the [Official GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger).
