# IOTA Client Library

:::warning Deprecated

The IOTA client libraries have been deprecated and replaced by the [IOTA SDK](/iota-sdk/welcome).

:::

The official client library for interacting with the IOTA Tangle allows you to:

- Create blocks and transactions.
- Sign transactions.
- Generate addresses.
- Interact with an IOTA node.

However, if you want to process value transfers, you should use our stateful [wallet library](wallet.md) instead.
