# Getting Started with Rust

<WarningPasswordStorage />

## Install the IOTA SDK

### Requirements

The IOTA SDK requires `Rust` and `Cargo`. You can find installation instructions in
the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

We recommend that you update the Rust compiler to the latest stable version first:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

#### Dependencies

You must also install `cmake`, `clang`, `pkg-config` and `openssl`. You may need to install additional build tools on
your system to run the build process successfully using Cargo.

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

You can install `cmake`, `clang`, and `openssl` with your distro's package manager or download them from their websites.
On Debian and Ubuntu, you will also need the `build-essential` and `libudev-dev` packages.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

You can install `cmake` and `openssl` with `Homebrew`:

```
brew install cmake openssl@1.1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

You can download `cmake` from the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/). You can install `openssl`
with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

<Tabs groupId="windowsPackageManager" queryString>
<TabItem value="vcpkg" label="vcpkg">

```shell
./vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
./vcpkg.exe integrate install
# You may want to add this to the system environment variables since you'll need it to compile the crate
set VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="chocolatey" label="chocolatey">

```
choco install openssl
# You may need to set the OPENSSL_DIR environment variable
set OPENSSL_DIR="C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Install the SDK Using Cargo

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cargo" label="Cargo add">

To start using the IOTA SDK in your Rust project, you can include it as a dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml` by running:

```bash
cargo add iota-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual" label="Cargo.toml">

To start using the IOTA SDK in your Rust project, you can include the following line under `dependencies` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
iota-sdk = "1.0.0"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Build the SDK from Source

1. Download the repository to any directory you choose:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk
   ```

2. Move to the base directory:

   ```shell
   cd iota-sdk/
   ```

3. Build the SDK by running the following:

   ```shell
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

### Client

To use the Client module, you simply need to create a `Client`.

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/client/getting_started.rs#L10-L23
```

### Wallet

To use the Wallet module, you need to create a `Wallet`.
For this example to work `features = ["stronghold"]` is needed in the Cargo.toml import. To persist the wallet in a database, `"rocksdb"` can be added.

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/wallet/getting_started.rs#L12-L56
```

## What's next?

### How-To Guides

Once you have [installed the IOTA SDK](#install-the-iota-sdk), you can start building your application. You can find
usage examples in this Wiki's [how-to guides](../how-tos/introduction.md).

### More Examples

You can use the provided code [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/sdk/examples) to get
acquainted with the IOTA SDK. You can use the following command to run any example:

```bash
cargo run --release --all-features --example example_name
```

- Where `example_name` is the name from
  the [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/sdk/sdk/Cargo.toml) name from the example folder.
  For example:

```bash
cargo run --release --all-features --example node_api_core_get_info
```

You can get a list of the available code examples with the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example
```

## API Reference

The IOTA SDK Rust API Reference is in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/).
