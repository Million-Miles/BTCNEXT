# Stardust Exchange Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the IOTA SDK into your exchange, custody solution, or product.

Features of the IOTA SDK:

- Secure seed management.
- Account management with multiple accounts and multiple addresses.
- Confirmation monitoring.
- Deposit address monitoring.
- Backup and restore functionality.

:::note Stardust Update

The Stardust update is a set of protocol changes that were first deployed to the Shimmer network.
See [What is Stardust?](/learn/protocols/stardust/introduction)
for an overview of its features or [TIPs](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips)
flagged `Stardust` for a deeper understanding of the protocol changes.

:::

### How Does It Work?

The IOTA SDK is a stateful library which provides an API for developers to build value transaction applications.
It offers abstractions to handle payments,
and can optionally interact with [Stronghold](/stronghold.rs/getting_started) for seed handling,
seed storage, and state backup.

You can use the following examples as a guide to implement the
[multi-account model](../explanations/accounts-and-addresses.md#multi-accountmodel).

<details>
<summary> If you were already supporting Shimmer with wallet.rs</summary>

The [IOTA SDK](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk) is a brand new project which is a combination and improvement
of both [iota.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs) and [wallet.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs).
If you were already supporting Shimmer with wallet.rs, we encourage you to switch to the SDK as wallet.rs will be
deprecated and not receive any updates anymore.

Most of the APIs are the same and the changes are fairly minimal, here are some of the major changes:

### 1. Set Up the IOTA SDK

#### Install the IOTA SDK

First, you should install the components needed to use the IOTA SDK and the binding of your choice; it may vary a bit
from language to language.

You can read more about [backup and security in this guide](/introduction/how_tos/backup_security).

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

Check out our [Getting Started with Rust](../getting-started/rust.mdx) guide for more detailed instructions.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cargo" label="Cargo add">

To start using the IOTA SDK in your Rust project, you can include it as a dependencies in your project's
`Cargo.toml` by running:

```bash
cargo add iota-sdk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual" label="Cargo.toml">

To start using the IOTA SDK in your Rust project, you can include the following line under
`dependencies` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
iota-sdk = "1.0.0"
```

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

Check out our [Getting Started with Python](../getting-started/python.mdx) guide for more detailed instructions.

```sh
pip install iota-sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Set Up you `.env` File

:::warning

This guide uses `dotenv` to share user-defined constants, like database paths, node URLs, and wallet credentials across
the code examples.
**This is for convenience only and shouldn't be done in production**.

:::

You can create a `.env` by running the following command:

```bash
touch .env
```

The following examples will need these variables to exist, here are some default values you can use but also change:

```bash
WALLET_DB_PATH="./wallet-database"
NODE_URL="https://api.testnet.shimmer.network"
STRONGHOLD_SNAPSHOT_PATH="./wallet.stronghold"
STRONGHOLD_PASSWORD="*K6%79#yeFn7AMQhMQ"
EXPLORER_URL="https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet"
```

### 2. Generate a Mnemonic

After you have created the `.env` file, you can initialize the `Wallet` instance with a secret manager
([`Stronghold`](/stronghold.rs/welcome) by default) and client options.

By default, the Stronghold file will be called `wallet.stronghold`.
It will store the seed (derived from the mnemonic) that serves as a cryptographic key from which all accounts and
related addresses are generated.

One of the key principles behind `Stronghold` is that is impossible to extract a mnemonic from it ever again, that is,
recover it from the `.stronghold` file.
That's why you should always back up your 24-word mnemonic and have it stored in
a safe place.
You deal with accounts using the `Wallet` instance exclusively, which abstracts away all internal
complexities and makes transacting in a network very easy and convenient.

:::warning Back up and Security

It is best practice to keep the `stronghold` password and the `stronghold` database on separate devices.

### 3. Create an Account for Each User

You can import the IOTA SDK and create a wallet using the following example:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create_account.rs#L13-L55
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create_account.py
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `Alias` must be unique and can be whatever fits your use case.
The `Alias` is typically used to identify an account later on.
Each account is also represented by an `index`, which is incremented by one every time a new account is
created.
You can refer to any account via its `index` or its `alias`.

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

You get an instance of any created account using
[`Wallet.get_account(accountId|alias)`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html#method.get_account)
or get all accounts with
[`Wallet.get_accounts()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html#method.get_accounts).

Common methods of an [`Account`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html)
instance include:

- [`account.addresses()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.addresses):
  Returns a list of addresses related to the account.
- [`account.generate_ed25519_addresses()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.generate_ed25519_addresses):
  Generates one or more new address(es) for the address index incremented by 1.
- [`account.balance()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.balance):
  Returns the balance for the given account.
- [`account.sync()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.sync):
  Sync the account information with the Tangle.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

You get an instance of any created account using
[`Wallet.getAccount(accountId|alias)`](../references/nodejs/classes/Wallet.md#getaccount)
or get all accounts with
[`Wallet.getAccounts()`](../references/nodejs/classes/Wallet.md#getaccounts).

Common methods of an [`Account`](../references/nodejs/classes/Account.md)
instance include:

- [`account.addresses()`](../references/nodejs/classes/Account.md#addresses):
  Returns a list of addresses related to the account.
- [`account.generateEd25519Addresses()`](../references/nodejs/classes/Account.md#generateed25519addresses):
  Generates one or more new address(es) for the address index incremented by 1.
- [`account.getBalance()`](../references/nodejs/classes/Account.md#getbalance):
  Returns the balance for the given account.
- [`account.sync()`](../references/nodejs/classes/Account.md#sync): Sync the
  account information with the Tangle.

### 4. Generate a User Address to Deposit Funds

The `wallet` module of the IOTA SDK is a stateful library.
This means it caches all relevant information in storage to provide performance benefits while dealing with,
potentially, many accounts and addresses.

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create_address.rs#L14-L54
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create-address.ts#L4-L39
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/create_address.py
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Every account can have multiple addresses.
Addresses are represented by an `index` which is incremented by one every time a new address is created.
You can access the addresses using the `account.addresses()` method:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
for address in account.addresses().await? {
    println!("{}", address.address());
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

```typescript
const addresses = await account.addresses();

for (const address of addresses) console.log(address.address);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
addresses = account.addresses()

for address in addresses:
    print(address.address)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can use the [Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network.md) to request test tokens and test your account.

There are two types of addresses, `internal` and `public` (external). This approach is known as a _BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic wallet (HD Wallet)_.

- Each set of addresses is independent of each other and has an independent `index` id.
- Addresses that are created by `account.generateEd25519Addresses()` are indicated as `internal=false` (public).
- Internal addresses (`internal=true`) are called `change` addresses and are used to send the excess funds to them.

### 5. Check the Account Balance

<WarningUnlockConditions />

You can get the available account balance across all addresses of the given account using the following example:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 6. Listen to Events

The IOTA SDK supports several events for listening. A provided callback is triggered as soon as an event occurs
(which usually happens during _syncing_).

You can use the following example to listen to new output events:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/sdk/examples/wallet/events.rs#L12-L86
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/exchange/4-listen-events.ts#L8-L60
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/exchange/4_listen_events.py#L6-L57
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Example output:**

```js
NewOutput: {
    output: {
        outputId: '0x2df0120a5e0ff2b941ec72dff3464a5b2c3ad8a0c96fe4c87243e4425b9a3fe30000',
        metadata: [Object],
        output: [Object],
        isSpent: false,
        address: [Object],
        networkId: '1862946857608115868',
        remainder: false,
        chain: [Array]
    },
    transaction: null,
    transactionInputs: null
}
```

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

Alternatively you can use
[`account.outputs()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.outputs)
to get all the outputs that are stored in the account, or
[`account.unspent_outputs()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.unspent_outputs)
, to get the unspent outputs only.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">
