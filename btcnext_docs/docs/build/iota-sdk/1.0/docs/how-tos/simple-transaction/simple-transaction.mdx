import TipFaucet from '../../_admonitions/_tip-faucet.md';

Once you have [created your account](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and
[requested funds from the faucet](./request-funds.mdx) you are ready to send your first
transaction.

<TipFaucet />

## Example Code

The following example will:

1. Create a wallet.
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Send 1 SMR to an address using the `Account.send_amount(addresses_with_amount, options)` function. Make sure to update the code sample to send to the address of your choice.

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Sync the account with the node to get the latest transactions by calling the [`Account.sync()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.sync)
   function.
3. Send 1 SMR to an address using the [`Account.send()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.send) function.
   Make sure to update the code sample to send to the address of your choice.
