# Manage a Chain

## Monitoring

You can view the chain state using the dashboard (`<URL>/wasp/dashboard` when using `node-docker-setup`).

## Manage Chain Configuration and Validators

You can manage the chain configuration and committee of validators by interacting with
the [Governance contract](/wasp-wasm/reference/core-contracts/governance/).

The “Chain Owner” is the only one who can perform administrative tasks.

### Change Chain Ownership

To change the chain ownership, the current “Chain Owner” must call `delegateChainOwnership` specifying the `agentID` of
the next owner. The next owner must call `claimChainOwnership` to finalize the process.

### Change Access Nodes

For new access nodes to join the network, they need to:

- Be added as a trusted peer to at least 1 of the existing nodes.
- Be added by the administrator to the list of access nodes by calling `changeAccessNodes`. There is a helper in
  wasp-cli to do so:

```shell
wasp-cli chain gov-change-access-nodes accept <pubkey (0x...)>
```

After this, new nodes should be able to sync the state and execute view queries (call view entry points).

You can remove an access node by calling `changeAccessNodes`.

Alternatively, you can add "non-permissioned" access nodes without the signature from the chain owner to add any node as an "access node".
You can do this by using the following command:

```shell
wasp-cli chain access-nodes <add|remove> <pubkey (0x...)>
```

This node won't be "officially" recognized by the committee but will still be able to sync the state and provide all regular functionality.

### Change the Set of Validators

You can do this in different ways, depending on who controls the [governor address](/tips/tips/TIP-0018#alias-output)
from the alias output of the chain.

- If the chain governor address is the chain committee, you can perform the rotation by calling
  `rotateStateController` after adding the next state controller via `addAllowedStateControllerAddress`.
- If the chain governor address is a regular user wallet that you control, you can issue the rotation transaction using wasp-cli:

```shell
wasp-cli chain rotate <new controller address>
```

Or:

```shell
wasp-cli chain rotate-with-dkg --peers=<...>
```
