This is without doubt the most active community and with nearly 50,000 members a great place for everyone that wants to learn more about IOTA and get to know the people involved.

Every aspect of the project is covered here in separate channels and you can find the whole range of this amazing community from serious mathematics and cryptographic topic up to memes and Fun channels.
