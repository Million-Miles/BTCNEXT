# Bug Bounties

Bug bounties are programs the IOTA and Shimmer networks implement to encourage security researchers and ethical
hackers to discover and report potential vulnerabilities in their respective systems. These programs play a crucial role
in maintaining the security and _integrity_ of the networks by proactively identifying and addressing security weaknesses.

By offering financial rewards or other incentives, bug bounty programs attract skilled individuals who thoroughly
analyze the networks' codebase, infrastructure, and protocols. These researchers aim to identify any loopholes,
vulnerabilities, or potential _exploits_ that malicious actors could exploit. Once a vulnerability is found, it is
reported to the development teams, who can take the necessary steps to mitigate the issue and enhance the overall
security of the networks.

Bug bounty programs enhance the security of the IOTA and Shimmer networks and foster a collaborative and
inclusive environment where security researchers and developers work together to build robust and resilient systems. By
incentivizing vulnerability identification and responsible disclosure, these programs contribute to the ongoing
improvement and evolution of the networks, ensuring they remain trustworthy and secure for all participants.

If you are a security researcher interested in contributing to the security of the IOTA or Shimmer networks, check the official bug bounty programs and guidelines the respective projects provide. Your expertise and
discoveries can significantly impact the security and reliability of these innovative technologies.
