# IOTA Community Treasury

The IOTA community treasury will be set up as soon as the IOTA network gets upgraded with the Stardust ledger, and smart contracts can be executed on the Mainnet. The IOTA Community will be able to use a budget of 50,000,000 IOTA to support the ecosystem via grants. Until this is possible, the community is also deciding on setting up a [Community Treasury Grant Committee](https://govern.iota.org/t/sgp-0005-shimmer-community-treasury-grant-committee/1576) for the Shimmer network.

## Initial Voting

The IOTA community has decided to set up the IOTA Community Treasury in IOTA's first-ever Governance vote completed on 14 June 2022. In the following [Blog - article](https://blog.iota.org/community-treasury-vote-final-results/), you will be able to see the vote results and find all further information regarding the initial vote to set up the IOTA Treasury.
