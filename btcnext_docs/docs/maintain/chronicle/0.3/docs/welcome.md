# Welcome

Chronicle provides tools for managing and accessing permanode solutions using the IOTA actor framework [backstage](https://github.com/iotaledger/backstage). With Chronicle, you can:

- Store IOTA messages in real time, using one or more [Scylla](https://www.scylladb.com/) clusters
- Explore stored messages using an HTTP API
- Store the data you want by modifying incoming messages
- Filter data to store it how and where you want (work in progress)

:::note

This is alpha software, so there may be performance and stability issues. Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/chronicle.rs/issues/new).
