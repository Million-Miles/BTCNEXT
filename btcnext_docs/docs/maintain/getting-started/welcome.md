# Welcome

Welcome to the "Maintain" section of the IOTA wiki. This section will help you set up and maintain IOTA node software
and INX plugins.

## Layer 1

### Hornet

[Hornet](/hornet/welcome) is a lightweight IOTA node written in Go. It's essential for maintaining the
IOTA network as it is made entirely of Hornet nodes. You can use the documentation to
[set up](/hornet/how_tos/using_docker) and
[configure](/hornet/how_tos/post_installation) your node.

### Chronicle

[Chronicle](/chronicle/welcome) is a permanode solution that allows you to store and retrieve IOTA
messages and data in real time.

## Layer 2

### WASP - IOTA Smart Contracts

[WASP](/wasp/running-a-node) is an INX plugin you can install and use to run your smart contract chain.
You can use the documentation to get your node up and running, and [set up](/wasp-cli/how-tos/setting-up-a-chain/) and
[manage](/wasp-cli/how-tos/chain-management) a chain, or check out the available
[configuration options](/wasp/configuration).
