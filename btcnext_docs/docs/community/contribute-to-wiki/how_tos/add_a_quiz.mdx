# How To Add A Quiz

You can simply add a Quiz to every page you like in the Wiki!

## Example Quiz

<Quiz questions={questions} />

## Add Your Quiz

Just add the following lines on top of the page.

```javascript
import Quiz from '@site/src/components/Quiz';
import questions from './example-questions.json';
```

Make sure that the Quiz path fits your folder structure. You may need to remove or add some `../`.

Add your questions in a seperate `.json` file with the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "questionText": "First Question?",
    "answerOptions": [
      { "answerText": "1. Answer", "isCorrect": false },
      { "answerText": "2. Answer", "isCorrect": false },
      { "answerText": "3. Answer", "isCorrect": true },
      { "answerText": "4. Answer", "isCorrect": false }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

Now you need to include the Quiz components where you want to show it

```

## Your Quiz

<Quiz questions={questions} />

```

That's all. Congratulations, you have created your own Quiz!
