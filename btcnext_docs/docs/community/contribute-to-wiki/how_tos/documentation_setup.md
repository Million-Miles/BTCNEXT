# Set Up Documentation

The IOTA Wiki pulls project documentation from external GitHub repositories. For that to work, each project needs to
maintain the same standard to keep itself compatible with the wiki's pipeline. For better reader experience, we also
recommend the same documentation structure for every project, as once you know how to navigate through a single IOTA
project, you know how to get around in any other.

For a technical setup, base your repository on the [documentation template](https://github.com/iota-wiki/docs-template) or
copy files from there. The `documentation` folder contains everything that is related to
documentation. `documentation/docs` contains all actual documentation. You can use the `documentation/static` folder to
store resources to your documentation. You can edit `sidebars.js` to include new articles to the table of contents.

The `documentation/docs` also contains preset folder structure that reflects
our [software documentation structure guidelines](../reference/structure/overview.md).
