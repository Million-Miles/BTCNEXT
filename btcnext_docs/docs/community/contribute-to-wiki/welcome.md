# Welcome

This is documentation section about IOTA documentation: what we write and how we write. This section covers everything you need to know to start contributing to the wiki, in the [How To](getting_started/developer.md) section you can find practical advice to improve your writing, and we keep all our guidelines under Reference. Our [manifesto](reference/style/manifesto.md) contains the gist of it.

## Chat with Us

IOTA Wiki maintainers hang out in the `#iota-wiki` channel of the [IOTA Discord server](/get-started/the-community/discord#join-the-iota-discord). You can always leave your feedback there or talk with a programmer, an artist, or a technical writer about your contribution.
