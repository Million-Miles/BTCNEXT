# Writing Tools

There are several writing tools you can use to improve your [style and grammar](#style-and-grammar)
, [structure](#structure), add [diagrams](../../reference/structure/overview.md)
and learn about [markdown and Docusaurus components](#markdown-and-components).

## Style and Grammar

### Grammarly

[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is browser extension that checks your spelling, grammar, punctuation, style and
even writing voice and tone.

### Hemingwayapp

[Hemingwayapp](https://hemingwayapp.com/) highlights and corrects grammar, fluency, and sentence structure in order
to help your writing read and look better.

### IOTA Wiki Style Guide

This wiki has its own [style guide](../../reference/style/manifesto.md) you can use so your writing is cohesive with the
rest of the wiki.

## Markdown and Components

### Markdown Guide

This wiki uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) as primary language. You can use
the [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to get started in no time.

### Docusaurus

This wiki is built using [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/). You can use
their [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) to learn all about its many features.

## Diagrams

### Diagrams.net

[diagrams.net (formerly draw.io)](https://app.diagrams.net/) is free online diagram software. You can use it as a
flowchart maker, network diagram software, to create UMLs online.

### Design Resources

You can find IOTA Wiki themed graphic resources in
the [Design Resources repository](https://github.com/iota-wiki/Design-Resources). You can add this repository
to [diagrams.net](#diagramsnet) in three simple steps:

1. Open [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/).
2. Click **File** > **Open Library From** > **URL**.
3. Paste the RAW URL of the library, for example:

```plaintext
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iota-wiki/Design-Resources/main/flowchart_library/flowchart.xml
```

## Structure

### Diataxis

Separating concerns in documentation makes it easier for the user to find what they are looking for. This wiki
uses [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr) to organize its documentation into four distinct categories. You can read more
about Diataxis in the Wiki in the [software documentation structure article](../../reference/structure/overview.md).

### IOTA Wiki

### Templates

The IOTA wiki hosts templates you can use
to [start your project's documentation](https://github.com/iota-wiki/docs-template)
and [write a tutorial](https://github.com/iota-wiki/tutorial-template/blob/main/documentation/docs/template.md)
