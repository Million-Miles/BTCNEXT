# Tutorials

A [tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) is the most complex type of documentation you will have. They usually
require regular effort to maintain them, touch a variety of subjects and should guide the user in much more detail than
[How Tos](how_tos.md) or [Explanations](explanations.md).

For more information on tutorials, please visit the [IOTA Wiki Tutorial template](https://github.com/iota-wiki/tutorial-template).
