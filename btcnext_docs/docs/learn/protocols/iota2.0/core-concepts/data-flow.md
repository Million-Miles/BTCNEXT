# Data Flow

This article provides a detailed description of the interaction between the IOTA 2.0 protocol components. You can divide the protocol into three main elements:

- A [_P2P overlay network_](#1-network-layer).
- An immutable [data structure](data-structures.md).
- A [consensus mechanism](consensus/introduction.md).

In the IOTA 2.0 protocol, these three elements are abstracted into layers, where upper layers build on the functionality of the layers below. The definition of these layers allows for different functionalities to be conveniently separated into modules and addressed individually. This article will describe all the modules and their interactions.

![Different layers of the protocol](/img/learn/protocols/iota2.0/core-concepts/data-flow/layers.png)  
**Image 1:** Different layers of the protocol.

## 1. Network Layer

The network will be maintained by the _network layer_ modules, which can be characterized as a pure P2P overlay network. This means that it is a system that runs on top of another network (e.g., the internet), but unlike client-server systems, all nodes have the same roles and perform the same actions.

IOTA 2.0's Network Layer consists of two primary modules: the _peer discovery_ module, which maintains a list of nodes actively using the network, and the neighbor selection module (also known as _autopeering_ module), which selects peers in a random secure way. The network layer also manages the gossip between nodes.

## 2. Communication Layer

The communication layer's concern is the information propagated through the network layer, contained in objects called blocks. This layer builds a _DAG_ with blocks as vertices called [The Tangle](data-structures.md): a replicated, shared, and distributed _data structure_ that emerges through a combination of deterministic rules, cooperation, and direct or virtual voting.

Since nodes have finite capabilities, the network can process a limited number of blocks. Thus, the network could become overloaded simply because of honest heavy usage or malicious (spam) attacks. To protect the network from coming to a halt or just getting inconsistent, the [rate control](communication-layer.md) and  [congestion control](communication-layer.md)
modules control when and how many blocks can be gossiped.

## 3. (Decentralized) Application Layer

The _application layer_  lives on top of the _communication layer_. The _application layer_  is mainly related to objects called payloads (e.g., transactions are a type of payload). Anybody can develop applications on this layer, and nodes can choose which applications to run. Of course, these applications can also be dependent on each other.

Nodes must also run several _core application_s, such as the engine, which maintains the [ledger state](data-structures.md) and a quantity called [Mana](mana.md). Mana is a scarce resource that serves as a _Sybil protection mechanism_ and spam protection. All nodes must also run the [Approval Weight and Finality Gadget](consensus/introduction.md) application, which provides a protocol that produces consensus between nodes on whether blocks are to be included in the Tangle (instead of being orphaned) and on whether transactions inside included blocks should mutate the ledger (instead of being deemed non-mutating). Lastly, the same gadget enables nodes to reorganize their perception of the Tangle when necessary, using the _fork-choice rule_.

## 4. Data Flow

### Overview

The diagram below represents the interaction between the different modules in the protocol. Each blue box represents a component with events that belong to it, represented by yellow boxes. Those events will trigger methods (the green boxes) that can also trigger other methods. This triggering is represented by the arrows in the diagram. Finally, the purple boxes represent events not belonging to the component that triggered them.

For example, take the _Parser_ component. The function `ProcessGossipBlock` will trigger the method `Parse`, the only component entry. There are three possible outcomes to the `Parser`:

1. Triggering a `ParsingFailed` event.
2. Triggering a `BlockFiltered` event.
3. Triggering a `BlockParsed` event.

In the last case, the event will trigger the `Attach` method (the entry to the Block DAG component), whereas the first two events do not trigger any other component.

![Data flow overview](/img/learn/protocols/iota2.0/core-concepts/data-flow/dataflow.png)  
**Image 2:** Data flow overview.

We present the data flow, i.e., the life cycle of a block, from _block reception_  (or creation) until acceptance in the Tangle. Notice that any block created locally by the node or received from a neighbor must pass through most of the data flow. Specifically, all blocks pass from the Block DAG component to the _Tip Manager_ and the consensus/Notarization. The Data Flow (Image 2) is almost precise; however, some of the components' explanations were simplified for didactic purposes. Please see the node software documentation for a precise representation of each component's implementation.

Finally, note that this Data Flow concerns _nodes_ and not _clients_. Clients generally do not contribute to consensus and just contain a [Block Factory](#41-block-factory).

### 4.1 Block Factory

The `IssuePayload` function creates a valid payload, provided to the `CreateBlock` method, along with a set of parents chosen with the [Tip Selection Algorithm](./communication-layer.md#tip-selection-algorithm). Then, the block is signed. Notice that block generation should follow the rates imposed by the _rate setter_, as defined in r [rate control](communication-layer.md), and that the block's type of references should be consistent with the preferred reality of the issuer(see the [consensus article](consensus/introduction.md).

All blocks have a _commitment field_, which is the hash of a series of information from older slots (see [Data Structures](data-structures.md)), e.g., the Merkle root of the Merkle Tree containing the blocks included in the older slots, ledger state at the end of the slots, or Block Issuance Credits.

There are certain rules for creating the commitment:
A block must not commit to excessively old slots, for example, the "genesis" slot.
A block must not commit to excessively recent slots. For example, the slot to which the block belongs, since the information the block commits to might still change.

By comparing these commitments, it becomes straightforward to identify the existence of divergences between the nodes' perceptions of the Tangle. Additionally, these commitments in the blocks enable the creation of _Slot Commitment Chain_s (see [Data Structures](data-structures.md) and the [Finality Gadget](consensus/introduction.md)).

### 4.2 Parser

After the block arrives in the _block inbox_ , the next step is parsing, where the received bytes are interpreted and translated into information that can be processed by nodes (a block, possibly containing a payload, with parents, timestamps, etc.). The parsing consists of the seven following filtering processes. Blocks that don't pass any of these steps will not continue the data flow:

#### 4.2.1 Recently seen bytes

This process compares the incoming blocks with a pool of recently seen bytes to filter duplicates. If the block does not pass this check, the block is dropped. If it passes the check, it goes to the next step.

#### 4.2.2 Parsing and syntactical validation

This process checks if the block and the payload (when present) are syntactically valid. In particular, this validation checks block length, number of parents, and the existence of trailing bytes left unparsed.

If the parsing fails, a `ParsingFailed` event is triggered; if the Syntactical Validation fails, a `BlockFiltered` event is triggered. If it passes both checks, it goes to the next step.

#### 4.2.3 Timestamp difference check

This process checks if the creation time of the payload and the block timestamps are consistent, i.e., if `transaction.creationtTime <= block.issuingTime`. This step is only executed when the block contains a payload.

If the block does not pass this check, a `BlockFiltered` event is triggered. If it passes the check, it goes to the next step. Additionally, a block will not pass this check if its timestamp is too far in the future.

#### 4.2.5 Mana check

This process checks if the RMC (Reference Mana Cost) requirements are met, as defined in  [Congestion Control](communication-layer.md). To summarize, this step checks if the Mana burnt in the block is larger or equal to the Reference Mana Cost of the slot times the block's workscore. Both the RMC and workscore calculations are objective, so if a block does not burn the required Mana, it can be directly rejected.

It also checks if the account _BIC_ committed at `maxCommitableAge` slots in the past is non-negative, among other account-related filters.

If the block does not pass this check, a `BlockFiltered` event is triggered. If it passes the check, it goes to the next step.

#### 4.2.6 Slot commitment check

This process checks if the slot the block commits to is neither too old nor too recent. If the block does not pass this check, a `BlockFiltered` event is triggered. If it passes the check, it goes to the next step.

#### 4.2.7 Signature check

This process checks if the _block signature_  is valid. If the block does not pass this check, a `BlockFiltered` event is triggered. If it passes the check, a `BlockParsed` event is issued, which will trigger the Block _DAG_ module.

### 4.3 Block DAG/Solidifier

Only the blocks that pass the Parser are stored in memory with some metadata as boolean flags set in future points of the data flow. This process takes place in the _Block DAG_ component, where blocks are causally ordered and their dependencies are defined.

_Solidification_ also takes place in the Block DAG. Solidification is the process of requesting missing blocks. In this step, the node checks if all the _past cone_ (see [consensus](consensus/introduction.md)) of the block is known. If the node realizes that a block in the past cone is missing, it will send a request to its _neighbors_ asking for that missing block. This process is recursively repeated until all of a block's past cone up to the genesis (or snapshot) becomes known to the node.

This way, the protocol enables any node to retrieve the entire block history (or at least until the last available snapshot) by processing the newly received blocks, even for nodes that have just joined the network.

When the solidification process of a block ends successfully, the protocol sets the `solid` flag in its metadata to `TRUE`.

If the process does not terminate successfully, the protocol will set the `invalid` flag to `TRUE`.

If, while solidifying, the node realizes that one of the parents of the block is `invalid`, the block itself is also marked as `invalid`.

The _solidifier_ will also perform the parents' age check. It consists of checking if the timestamp of the block and the timestamps of each of its parents are monotonic: `block.issuingTime >= parent.issuingTime`.

This condition is necessary to guarantee the monotonicity of the Tangle, i.e., that the timestamps of the blocks increase with respect to the direction in which the Tangle is growing. As in the solidification case, the block is marked as `invalid` if the above condition is not met. If the block passes all the checks above, a `BlockSolid` event is issued, which will trigger the Booker module.

### 4.4 Booker

After solidification, the block moves on to the _booker_, where transactions are causally ordered, conflicts are identified, and the ledger state is updated.

Booking a transaction does not mean confirming a transaction. Our protocol optimistically books transactions even when they conflict, tracks these conflicts and their dependencies accordingly, and creates a collection of different realities (see [Reality-based UTXO ledger](consensus/introduction.md)) that are collapsed into a single confirmed reality at the end of the consensus process.

The booking step is different between blocks that contain a transaction payload and blocks that do not contain it. In the case of a block without a transaction payload, booking into the Tangle occurs after the block has waited in a buffer until all its parents are booked. In the booking process, all conflicts are inherited from the parents, and a `BlockBooked` event is issued. This step allows the opinion of the block to be constructed. If any of the parents are marked as `invalid`, the block is also marked as `invalid` and a `BlockInvalid` event is issued.

In the case of a block with a transaction payload, the transaction must be booked before the block can be booked. As in the case of blocks, booking only happens after the transaction has waited in a buffer for all its inputs to be booked. If any of the inputs are marked as `invalid`, the transaction is also marked as `invalid`, and a `TransactionInvalid` event is issued. Otherwise, the transaction is sent to the VM, where it will be executed. If the execution is successful, the data flow continues (meaning that the transaction is booked and the component will now try to book the block); if the execution fails, a `TransactionInvalid` event is issued and the block is not booked.

When the transaction is executed, the booking process in the ledger checks if any of the consumed inputs have more than one spender. If they do, a new conflict is created and added to a `ConflictSet`, which contains all the spenders of the output, out of which only 1 can be accepted.

The _VM_ will only execute the transaction if it passes objective checks, particularly the following:

#### Balances check

This process checks if the values of the generated outputs respect the transaction validation rules. Particularly, it checks if the sum of the IOTA values of the generated outputs equals the sum of the IOTA values of the consumed inputs (analogously, checks are done for any other native tokens).

It also checks if the Mana values of the generated outputs follow the Mana validation rules (see [Data structures](data-structures.md)). If the transaction does not pass this check, it is marked as `invalid` and not executed. If it passes the check, it goes to the next step.

#### Unlock conditions

This process checks that the unlock conditions of the transaction are valid. If the transaction(see [Data structures](data-structures.md)) fails to pass this check, it is marked as `invalid` and not executed. If it passes the check, it goes to the next step.

#### Inputs' validity check

This process checks that all the consumed inputs are not conflicting. If the transaction fails to pass this check, it is marked as `invalid` and not executed.

Finally, whenever a block is booked, it triggers the _Scheduler_ and the consensus components (which work in parallel).

### 4.5 Scheduler

You can think of the scheduler as a gatekeeper that offers protection for your neighbors, since the protocol only gossips blocks that it has scheduled.

Once the steps above are successful, the block is enqueued into the _outbox_. The outbox is split into several queues, each corresponding to a different block issuer. Those separate queues ensure that the minimum share of _throughput_ reserved to a certain block issuer is not affected by the network usage of the other nodes. Furthermore, separating blocks into different queues guarantees that no _block issuers_ will have their blocks delayed because of spamming from other issuers (see the Scheduler description in the [Communication Layer wiki page](communication-layer.md)).

Once the block is enqueued into the right queue, this queue is sorted by block timestamp in increasing order. This ensures that blocks are scheduled in the same order by every node with high probability. Furthermore, blocks can only be scheduled when ready, meaning that all parents are scheduled or accepted.

The dequeuing process (i.e., fetching the blocks from these queues to be gossiped and added to the tip pool) uses a modified version of the deficit round robin (_DRR_) algorithm, as described in [Congestion Control](communication-layer.md). A maximum (fixed) global `SCHEDULING_RATE`, at which blocks will be scheduled, is set.

In severe congestion, when the buffer length exceeds a maximum length parameter, blocks will be dropped from the issuer queue's tail (latest timestamp). This buffer management policy favors the highest Mana nodes during periods of severe congestion, dropping blocks from low-Mana issuers first.

Blocks that are scheduled by the node can be gossiped and added to the tip pool.

### 4.6 Tip Manager

A scheduled block is finally added to one of two tip sets, "strong" and "weak" (for more details on the Tip Selection and Tip Pools, see [Tip selection](consensus/introduction.md). Additionally, all strong parents of the scheduled block that are still part of the strong tip set are removed from it, whereas any parent in the weak tip is removed regardless of the reference type.

The tip selection mechanism performs a uniform random tip selection from a subset of the tip pool to guarantee good properties of the Tangle. Specifically, it will select tips uniformly at random only from tips that are not excessively old and pass the fishing condition. For that reason, when a block is to be issued and its parents are selected, the _tip manager_ will check if the selected parents respect these conditions and discard them if needed. In that case, the discarded parent is also removed from the tip set and a new parent is selected until the required number of parents is met.

After selecting parents, the algorithm chooses the type of reference (strong, weak, etc.) it uses for each parent, depending on the opinion the node has about the past cones of these parents (see [consensus article](consensus/introduction.md)).

Finally, if the block being issued is a [validation block](mana.md#validation-blocks), the tip selection may differ from the tip selection of regular blocks; specifically, committee members will always try to reference all known blocks from other committee members (in addition to the random tips). For more details on the validation block tip selection, see the [consensus article](consensus/introduction.md).

### 4.7 Consensus and Notarization

Booked blocks continue to the consensus and notarization component. In this component, the newly booked blocks will propagate the `Witness Weight` and `Approval Weight` from validation blocks to the blocks in their past cone and transactions they approve (see [consensus article](consensus/introduction.md)).

This propagation is independent: blocks always propagate _Witness Weight_ but not necessarily _Approval Weight_, which depends on the type of reference that the block uses.
When blocks and transactions reach a certain Witness and _Approval Weight_ threshold, they are marked as `accepted` and `confirmed` (among other flags). Finally, these flags trigger the Notarization process, creating slot commitments.
