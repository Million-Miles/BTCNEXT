# White Flag Consensus

The White Flag Consensus is a novel approach to handling conflicts within a blockchain network, particularly for
transaction _confirmation_ and double-spend handling.

In many blockchain systems, the threat of double spends - attempts to spend the same digital tokens more than once -
pose significant security concerns. White Flag Consensus offers an innovative solution to efficiently and
deterministically resolve these conflicts.

## Key Aspects of White Flag Consensus

Unlike traditional _consensus_ mechanisms that often require complex and resource-intensive calculations to decide which
of the _conflicting transactions_ to approve, White Flag Consensus simplifies this process.

Under the White Flag approach, transactions are confirmed without any voting or other _consensus mechanism_ to decide
between conflicting transactions. Instead, it uses a deterministic method that decides the confirmation order of
transactions based on their appearance in the past milestone. In essence, it retroactively determines the
order of transactions, removing the need for decision-making during the _transaction confirmation_ phase.

## Handling Double Spends

In the case of double spends, White Flag Consensus chooses to approve the first transaction that does not conflict with
the transactions approved in the past.
Any conflicting transactions that appear later are automatically ignored and left unconfirmed.
This deterministic approach means that every node will reach the same state without communicating or coordinating.

## Benefits of White Flag Consensus

The White Flag Consensus approach offers several key benefits:

1. **Efficiency**: By removing the need for _consensus_ voting, it can confirm transactions more quickly and with fewer
   computational resources.

2. **Predictability**: Its deterministic nature makes the __confirmation_ process_ predictable, as the state of the ledger
   after confirming a milestone does not depend on the order in which transactions are processed.

3. **Security**: It provides a robust mechanism for handling double spends, enhancing the network's security.
