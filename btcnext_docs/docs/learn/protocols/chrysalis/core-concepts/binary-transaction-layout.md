# Binary Transaction Layout

## Binary vs. Trinary

In the past, IOTA used trinary data formats.
The decision was based on the fact that trinary logic systems can theoretically store and process information more
efficiently than binary systems.
However, in practice, the digital world is built upon binary logic, leading to trinary _data structure_ challenges, such as transaction payloads.

Binary transaction payloads, on the other hand, align more closely with conventional technology standards, offering
several benefits over their trinary counterparts.

## Computational Efficiency

Most modern hardware, programming languages, and communication protocols are designed to operate on binary data.
Thus, when dealing with binary transaction payloads, these systems can process the data directly,
resulting in a smoother and more efficient computational process.
On the other hand, trinary payloads require conversion to binary before most systems can process them, leading to
additional computational overhead.

## Compatibility and Interoperability

Binary transaction payloads enhance compatibility and _interoperability_ with existing systems.
As most technologies used today are based on binary logic,
adopting binary payloads simplifies integration efforts and reduces the likelihood of compatibility issues.
This advantage makes it easier for developers and platforms to adopt and interact with IOTA using binary payloads.

## Ease of Integration and Development

The prevalence of binary systems also extends to development tools and libraries.
Developers have a wealth of resources and tools optimized for binary data,
which eases integration, boosts development speed, and reduces the chances of errors.
When using trinary payloads, the pool of available resources is significantly reduced,
potentially slowing development and increasing complexity.
