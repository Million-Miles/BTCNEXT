# Introduction

Blockchain technology is constantly evolving, seeking to address scalability, speed, and efficiency issues. In line
with these advancements, the IOTA Foundation has introduced a significant upgrade known as the Chrysalis protocol.

## What is the IOTA Chrysalis Protocol?

Chrysalis represents a significant update in the transition to IOTA 2.0, or Coordicide.
It incorporates many changes to improve network performance, security, and ease of use.

Chrysalis is designed to address several existing limitations within the IOTA protocol and prepare the network for the
future removal of the Coordinator, a unique node currently providing network security.

Chrysalis aims to make the network more robust and efficient, suitable for more extensive enterprise use and adoption.
It will also create a more user-friendly environment for developers to create applications on the IOTA network.

## Key Features of Chrysalis

**Efficiency**: The [transition from a ternary to a binary system](core-concepts/binary-transaction-layout.md) through
Chrysalis enhances computational efficiency and increases compatibility with standard hardware and software systems.

**Security**: Chrysalis introduces [EdDSA signatures](core-concepts/EdDSA-support.md),
and [White Flag Consensus](core-concepts/white-flag-consensus.md) enhancing transaction security
and enabling the reusability of private keys and addresses.

**Scalability**: Chrysalis allows IOTA to [switch to a UTXO model](core-concepts/switch-to-UTXO.md), ]
enhancing the network's ability to identify and resolve conflicts and improve scalability.

**Ease of use**: The protocol upgrade will set the foundation for new tools, libraries, and software, making it
easier to build on the IOTA network.
