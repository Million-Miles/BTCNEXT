This version of IOTA Identity is the last version targeting Chrysalis networks and is deprecated. Please upgrade to the latest version of [IOTA Identity for Stardust Networks](/identity.rs/0.7/introduction/).

Also, with Identity Rust 0.6.3 and Wasm 0.6.1 a breaking change was introduced that requires a migration of existing Stronghold Snapshot files. You can find migration instructions [here](/identity.rs/0.6/tutorials/migrate-stronghold/).
